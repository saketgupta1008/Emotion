L30250 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
L30249 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Why?
L30248 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You might be disappointed.

L30244 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
L30243 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.

L30228 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
L30227 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
L30226 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
L30225 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
L30224 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Good morning.
L30223 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Maestro.

L30336 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
L30332 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
L30331 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What??
L30330 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Is she a good fuck?
L30325 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ I'm so relieved.
L30324 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, she's fine.
L30323 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Is her mother still lying on the floor?
L30322 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh - excuse me!
L30305 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L30304 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Don't bother.
L30303 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What?
L30302 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Don't bother!
L30301 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
L30356 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
L30355 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ You have leave to try.
L30354 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
L30353 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ And how will you make him keep it?
L30352 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
L30351 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
L30350 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Sir -
L30349 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
L30348 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
L30347 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ Hardly.
L30346 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
L30345 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ No! I won't have him back.
L30102 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
L30101 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
L30100 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
L30099 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
L30098 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
L30097 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Humiliated?
L30096 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
L30095 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why what, sir?
L30983 +++$+++ u246 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COMMENDATORE +++$+++ Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.

L31026 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.

L30412 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!

L30410 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?

L30402 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
L30401 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ They'll come anyway. They love me here.
L30400 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
L30399 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, leave me alone.

L30062 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Do you think that's funny?
L30061 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why? People fart backwards.
L30060 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ That's stupid.
L30059 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
L30058 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Why not?
L30057 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
L30056 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
L30055 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Fartsbishop!

L31330 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
L31329 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
L31324 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
L31323 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
L31322 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ This is not his handwriting.
L31317 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ And I'm asking you -
L31316 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ He asked me to stay.
L31315 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.

L31312 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I was at hand.
L31311 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Why you?
L31310 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
L31309 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L30482 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
L30481 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What?
L30480 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
L30464 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
L30463 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ But! I'm a married woman!
L30462 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
L30461 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Isn't it obvious?
L30460 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L30459 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Some service deserves service in return. No?
L30458 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ What for?
L30457 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Alone.
L30456 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Tonight?
L30455 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Come back tonight.
L30454 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Oh, thank you, sir!
L30453 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
L30451 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
L30450 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ It is miraculous.
L30445 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
L30444 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ These are originals?
L30443 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Yes.
L30442 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Originals?
L30441 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
L30440 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
L30439 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
L30438 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
L30434 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
L30433 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I see.
L30432 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ No, sir. This is my own idea.
L30431 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Then he didn't send you?
L30430 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
L30429 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Really?
L30428 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
L30427 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
L30426 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
L30425 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
L30424 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I understand.
L30423 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ He's terribly busy, sir.
L30422 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
L30421 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
L30420 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Frau Mozart?
L30419 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Madame. How can I help you?
L30418 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Excellency!
L31115 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
L31114 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
L31113 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Money! Money!
L31112 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
L31111 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
L31110 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!

L31108 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
L31107 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Leave him alone!
L31106 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
L31085 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I hope so. I need it immediately.
L31084 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
L31083 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Where's our friend?
L31082 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Not at all.
L31081 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Am I interrupting something?
L31017 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
L31016 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ How much will you pay him?
L30740 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Do you hear him? Do you?
L30739 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
L30738 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
L30737 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
L30736 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
L30723 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
L30722 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
L30721 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.

L30267 +++$+++ u249 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FLUNKY +++$+++ I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
L30264 +++$+++ u254 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MADAME WEBER +++$+++ Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
L30263 +++$+++ u249 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FLUNKY +++$+++ I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
L30262 +++$+++ u254 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MADAME WEBER +++$+++ Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
L30261 +++$+++ u249 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FLUNKY +++$+++ I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
L30260 +++$+++ u254 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MADAME WEBER +++$+++ Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
L30617 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Yes. He is a little strange.
L30616 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ What a strange young man.
L30606 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Michael!
L30605 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ I said play!
L30582 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
L30581 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
L30580 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
L30579 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Gertrude!
L30578 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
L30575 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ You can't be Herr Mozart!
L30574 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Gertrude!
L30573 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Upstairs.
L30602 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
L30601 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
L30600 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Who was your teacher?
L30599 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Just one year.
L30589 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Wine?
L30588 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
L30587 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
L30584 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Ah, now! Here she comes.
L30583 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Really?
L30889 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, look at them.
L30888 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
L30887 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Do you like this, Salieri?
L30521 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
L30520 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yes?
L30519 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
L30518 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Really?
L30517 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
L30516 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Of course not.
L30515 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
L30514 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Oh?
L30513 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
L30512 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Why not?
L30511 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
L30510 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
L30378 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well. There it is.
L30377 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Sire.
L30376 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
L30375 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
L30374 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
L30373 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
L30372 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ And the result satisfies.
L30371 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
L30370 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yes?
L30369 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
L30368 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
L30367 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
L30365 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Your Highness.
L30364 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
L30204 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
L30203 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
L30202 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, I'm glad to hear that.
L30179 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
L30178 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ My pleasure.
L30170 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
L30169 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
L30156 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah-ha!
L30155 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ A-flat, Majesty.
L30154 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
L30153 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You do me too much honour, Sire.
L30152 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
L30151 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Majesty.
L30150 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ May I try it?
L30149 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ It's just a trifle, of course.
L30148 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ What a charming idea. May I see?
L30124 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
L30123 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
L30833 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
L30832 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
L30831 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
L30821 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
L30820 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
L30819 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
L30818 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I have no idea.
L30817 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
L30816 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah, love again.
L30815 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
L30814 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
L30813 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
L30812 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
L30809 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
L30808 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Would you tell me why?
L30807 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, yes, I admit it is.
L30806 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
L30805 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Who told you this, Majesty?
L30804 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
L30803 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes, Sire.
L30802 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
L30768 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah! By all means.
L30767 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
L30766 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ What is it?
L30765 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
L30762 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Thank you, Sire!
L30761 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
L30296 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
L30295 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Twenty-six.
L30294 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Excuse me, but how old are you?
L30293 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
L30292 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
L30290 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Enchanted, Madame.
L30289 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
L30285 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
L30284 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
L30281 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
L30280 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
L30277 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
L30276 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What do you mean, Sire?
L30275 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
L30274 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
L30273 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
L30272 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ And German?
L30271 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yes, indeed.
L30270 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
L30213 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I think so, Sire, yes.
L30212 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ What? On one hearing only?
L30211 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
L30195 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah-ha.
L30194 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
L30193 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yes, where?
L30192 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
L30191 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
L30187 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
L30186 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Why so?
L30181 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
L30180 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Majesty!
L30177 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
L30176 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
L30168 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
L30167 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
L30166 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, thank you.
L30162 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
L30161 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Your Majesty!
L30146 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
L30145 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ He's here.
L30144 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yes, what about him?
L30143 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
L30142 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, what do you have for me today?
L30126 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well. There it is.
L30125 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L30119 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
L30118 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
L30115 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
L30114 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
L30113 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
L30775 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
L30774 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Father -
L30735 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ She does. She says I sleep all day.
L30734 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No one calls you that.
L30733 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
L30732 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Papa!
L30731 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
L30716 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
L30715 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Are you playing a trick on me?
L30714 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Mine?
L30713 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Papa, is this your idea?
L30683 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
L30682 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
L30679 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
L30678 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
L30673 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ This is just a game, Papa.
L30672 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ No, really!
L30669 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
L30668 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
L30662 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
L30661 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
L30660 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
L30652 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
L30651 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ You don't have secrets from me.
L30650 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's a secret.
L30649 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Why not?
L30648 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, let's not talk about it.
L30647 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ What's that?
L30646 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ This one will.
L30645 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
L30644 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
L30643 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ How many?
L30642 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes.
L30641 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Yes.
L30640 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Pupils?
L30639 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ How many pupils do you have?
L30638 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
L30637 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ They say you're in debt.
L30636 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
L30635 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ That's not what I hear.
L30634 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It couldn't be better.
L30633 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ How is your financial situation?
L30632 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
L30631 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Don't you have a maid?
L30630 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
L30627 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
L30626 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Do you always live like this?
L30625 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
L30624 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Is she not here?
L30623 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
L30621 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
L30620 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Am I not welcome?
L30619 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why are you here?
L30359 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I will.
L30358 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
L31131 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Are you sure it's an opera?
L31130 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
L31129 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Opera? Opera!
L31128 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
L31127 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Is he working?
L31126 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
L31125 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Is he working?
L31124 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
L31123 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Where?
L31122 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ I don't know. He has pains.
L31121 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What medicine?
L31120 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
L31119 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Why? What has happened?
L31118 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
L31117 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
L30760 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ In there, sir.
L30759 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Where does he work?
L30757 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes what?
L30756 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ I think I've found out about the money, sir.
L30754 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
L30753 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
L30752 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Really? What is it he's writing?
L30751 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
L30750 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
L30749 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Not that I've seen.
L30748 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Do any pupils come to the house?
L30747 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Oh, thank you, sir.
L30222 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Bene.
L30221 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
L30135 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Bene! Bene!
L30134 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Yes, thank you, sir.
L30133 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
L30132 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ I will, sir.
L30131 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
L30130 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What have you got for me today? Let me see.
L30129 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Good morning, sir.
L30128 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
L30712 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
L30711 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
L30708 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
L30707 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What?
L30706 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
L30705 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ That's right.
L30704 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Are you Herr Mozart?
L30703 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes?
L31104 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ So let me see it. Where is it?
L31103 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, we can.
L31102 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
L31101 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Because there's nothing to see.
L31100 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Why not?
L31099 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No.
L31098 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Can I see it?
L31097 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes.
L31096 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
L31095 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What?
L31094 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
L31093 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
L31092 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ What is this?
L31091 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Put it down!
L31090 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Wolfi!
L31089 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Leave that alone!
L31015 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ So there you are. What do you say?
L31014 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
L31013 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
L31012 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ German!
L31011 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
L31010 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
L31009 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Animals?
L31008 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ 'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
L31007 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
L31006 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
L31005 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I liked the horse.
L31004 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Yes, well, it's all good fun.
L31003 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
L30920 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ That kind of music should be punishable by death.
L30919 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Sublime! Utterly sublime!
L30918 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well?
L30681 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
L30680 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ What did he say? What did he say?
L30496 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sssh! Stay here.
L30495 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
L30494 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sssh!
L31043 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ My answer is no, Mozart.
L31042 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
L31041 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ I'm sorry. No.
L31040 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
L31039 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
L31038 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
L31037 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ What for?
L31036 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
L31035 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
L31034 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
L31033 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
L31032 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
L31031 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
L30615 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
L30614 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
L30598 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
L30597 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
L30586 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
L30585 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
L30577 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
L30576 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'm afraid I am.
L30572 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
L30571 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Madame.
L30570 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
L30568 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
L30567 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ And which one of them do you want me to teach?
L30566 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
L31308 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
L31307 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What for?
L31306 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I am so ashamed.
L31305 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I'm not leaving you.
L31304 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
L31303 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
L31302 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
L31301 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
L31300 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Do you want to rest a bit?
L31299 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
L31298 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.
L31297 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Do you have it?
L31296 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You go fast!
L31295 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ And that's it. Do you have it?
L31292 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes!
L31291 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes, and on 'dictis'.
L31290 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
L31289 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
L31288 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
L31287 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ That's wonderful!
L31285 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Show me.
L31284 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I think so.
L31283 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Do you have me?
L31281 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
L31280 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ And that's all?
L31279 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
L31278 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Also identical?
L31277 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ With the tenors.
L31276 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
L31275 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It couldn't be simpler.
L31274 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Please! Just one moment.
L31273 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
L31272 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
L31271 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.
L31270 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
L31269 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sing it back.
L31268 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I think so.
L31267 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
L31266 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.
L31265 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
L31264 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Common time.
L31263 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What time?
L31262 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ The Fire.
L31261 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ So now - A minor. Suddenly.
L31260 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.
L31259 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ We ended in F Major?
L31258 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Confutatis Maledictis.
L31257 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Come. Let's begin.
L31256 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Strange!
L31255 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L31254 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
L31253 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What?
L31252 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Do you believe in it?
L31251 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Consigned to flames of woe.
L31250 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
L31249 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
L31248 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Where did I stop?
L31238 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
L31237 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
L31236 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
L31235 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Of course.
L31234 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
L31233 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
L31232 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Would you? Actually, you could.
L31231 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
L31230 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
L31211 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ He knows. He knows!
L31210 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Finish what?
L31209 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
L31207 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What man?
L31206 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ The man. He's here.
L31205 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Who?
L31204 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No! No, it's him!
L31203 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Shall I answer it?
L31202 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'm too young to be so sick.
L31201 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What?
L31200 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ The doctor thinks I am. But -
L31199 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Are you ill?
L31198 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
L31197 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I do.
L31196 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Do you mean that?
L31195 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
L31194 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ This is only a vaudeville.
L31193 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
L31192 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
L31191 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ No, please.
L31190 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
L31189 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You mean she's not coming back?
L31188 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
L31187 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Where is your wife?
L31183 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, no. I have to get back. I have -
L31182 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I'm taking you home. You're not well.
L31181 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What happened? Is it over?
L31134 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
L31133 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Are you neglecting my request?
L31132 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
L31062 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
L31061 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ How long will you give me?
L31059 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ How much?
L31058 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
L31057 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Who are you?
L31056 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
L31055 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What dead? Who is dead?
L31054 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ A Mass for the dead.
L31053 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What work?
L31052 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I have come to commission work from you.
L30929 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
L30928 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You flatter me.
L30927 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I never knew that music like that was possible.
L30926 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes?
L30925 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ How could it not, Excellency?
L30924 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Did my work please you?
L30923 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ How could I not?
L30922 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Mozart. It was good of you to come.
L30915 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
L30914 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
L30913 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
L30912 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
L30911 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
L30910 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
L30909 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
L30908 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I think it's marvelous. Truly.
L30907 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
L30906 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
L30905 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But what is it they don't like?
L30904 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
L30903 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
L30880 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Thank you! Oh, thank you.
L30879 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ With all my heart, Mozart.
L30878 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, Excellency, would you?
L30877 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
L30876 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
L30875 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ How fortunate.
L30874 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
L30873 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You burned the score?
L30872 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
L30871 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
L30870 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
L30869 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Really? Why?
L30868 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
L30867 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
L30565 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
L30564 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I can't say. Really
L30563 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What exactly are you working on?
L30562 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
L30561 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
L30560 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Ah. Italian?
L30559 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
L30558 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
L30557 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
L30556 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
L30555 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
L30554 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
L30553 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I'm afraid not.
L30552 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Do you have a daughter?
L30551 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Of course not.
L30550 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
L30549 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
L30548 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
L30547 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
L30546 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
L30545 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
L30544 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
L30543 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
L30542 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
L30541 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
L30540 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
L30539 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Herr Sommer.
L30538 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Whom did they choose?
L30537 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
L30536 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
L30535 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
L30534 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
L30533 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
L30532 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
L30531 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
L30530 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
L30529 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ So you are. How is your pretty wife?
L30528 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
L30527 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
L30329 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
L30328 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ How could I not?
L30327 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Did you like it, then?
L30326 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
L30283 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But this is absurd!
L30282 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
L30206 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
L30205 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Love, Sire!
L30175 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
L30174 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Ah!
L30173 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Mio caro Adone.
L30172 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Really?
L30171 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
L30895 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
L30894 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
L30864 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Taking out what you should never have put in.
L30863 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What are you doing, Herr Director?
L30860 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
L30859 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
L30858 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Exactly. A dance.
L30857 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
L30856 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
L30854 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Certainly, Herr Director.
L30853 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
L30837 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Just let me tell you how it begins.
L30836 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ That will do, Herr Mozart!
L30811 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But, Your Majesty -
L30810 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
L30199 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
L30198 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Then why especially does it have to be in German?
L30197 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Exactly.
L30196 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ You mean in Turkey?
L30190 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ I think you'd better.
L30189 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
L30188 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Oh? Have I seen it?
L30839 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
L30838 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Herr Mozart -
L30397 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
L30396 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
L30395 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
L30394 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Mozart -
L30393 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
L30392 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Mozart -
L30391 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
L30390 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
L30389 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Who is on this committee?
L30388 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ A little modesty would suit you better.
L30387 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, but I'm the best.
L30386 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
L30385 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
L30384 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ On the contrary.
L30383 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Is the Emperor angry with me?
L30382 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Because His Majesty wishes it.
L30381 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
L30380 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ What is what?
L30379 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
L30826 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
L30825 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
L30824 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
L30823 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
L30822 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Mozart -
L30764 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Baron!
L30763 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
L30201 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
L30200 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
L30185 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
L30184 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ I don't think it was really decided, Director.
L31341 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
L31340 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Oh my son, my poor son!
L31339 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
L31338 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
L31337 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ What difference does that make?
L31336 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ But not his body.
L31335 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ I poisoned his life.
L31334 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ No, you didn't!
L31333 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ I did.
L31332 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
L31076 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
L31075 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Yes.
L31074 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
L31073 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ What?
L30474 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
L30473 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
L30472 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
L30471 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ My son, no one can speak for God.
L30470 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
L30469 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
L30468 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ No? Was Mozart a good man?
L30467 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ You cannot say that!
L30466 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
L30342 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
L30341 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Did you try?
L30340 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
L30029 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
L30028 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Do you hear me?
L30026 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Should I?
L30025 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Do you believe it?
L30024 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Is it true?
L30023 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ And do they believe it?
L30022 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ All Vienna has heard that.
L30021 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Ah - you've heard that?
L30020 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
L30019 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
L30018 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
L30017 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
L30016 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ I regret it is not too familiar.
L30015 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Well?
L30013 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
L30012 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ I can't say I do. What is it?
L30011 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Then you must know this.
L30010 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Here in Vienna.
L30009 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Where?
L30008 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
L30007 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ How well are you trained in music?
L30006 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
L30005 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ I do not seek forgiveness.
L30004 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
L30003 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Are they?
L30002 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
L30001 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
L30000 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
L29999 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Leave me alone.
L29998 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
L29997 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ What do you want?
L29996 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ In the sight of God that is a sin.
L29995 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ So?
L29994 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
L29993 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ About what?
L29992 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
L29991 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ What do you want?
L30852 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, in the third act.
L30851 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
L30850 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
L30849 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Ballet? What ballet?
L30848 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ About the ballet.
L30847 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ What anger?
L30844 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ The Emperor has given him permission.
L30843 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Incredible.
L30842 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
L30794 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Never mind.
L30793 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Where?
L30792 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I've seen the manuscript.
L30791 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Are you absolutely sure?
L30787 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ You must be mad.
L30786 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.
L30785 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ He's setting that play to music?
L30784 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Exactly.
L30783 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ You mean that play?
L30780 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Italian?
L30779 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
L30778 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Yes?
L30777 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
L30799 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Ah.
L30798 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
L30797 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Oh yes, yes. And that was?
L30796 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
L30795 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
L30183 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Did we?
L30182 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
L30159 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Well done, Sire!
L30158 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Bravo, Your Majesty!
L31180 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
L31179 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
L31178 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
L31177 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ What do you mean - now?
L31176 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Well, promise then.
L31175 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ I can't wait.
L31174 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
L31173 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
L31172 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
L31171 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ What? Who the devil are you?
L31170 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Here I am, my angel.
L31050 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
L31049 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
L31048 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
L31047 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
L31046 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I agree, Baron.
L31045 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
L30526 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Come with me. And stay in the room.
L30525 +++$+++ u264 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SERVANT +++$+++ He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
L30524 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What does he want?
L30478 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Show her in. Then go to bed.
L30477 +++$+++ u264 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SERVANT +++$+++ That lady is back, sir.
L30417 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Excuse me, my dear.
L30416 +++$+++ u264 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SERVANT +++$+++ She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
L30415 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Who is she?
L30414 +++$+++ u264 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SERVANT +++$+++ Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
L31226 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
L31225 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
L31223 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
L31222 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I'll call tomorrow.
L31221 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Bene.
L31220 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
L31219 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Of course.
L31218 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
L31217 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
L31216 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ But he's all right?
L31215 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
L31214 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Can we come in?
L31213 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, I am looking after him.
L31212 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Herr Salieri.
L650415 +++$+++ u8886 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ DEZERAE +++$+++ Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
L650414 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Sounds good - thank you
L650413 +++$+++ u8886 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ DEZERAE +++$+++ Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
L650412 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
L650411 +++$+++ u8886 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ DEZERAE +++$+++ Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
L650410 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I thought you were someone else
L650409 +++$+++ u8886 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ DEZERAE +++$+++ A person could get killed round here just for working late
L650408 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm sorry - I didn't think
L650407 +++$+++ u8886 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ DEZERAE +++$+++ OH MY GAWD!
L650274 +++$+++ u8886 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ DEZERAE +++$+++ Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
L650273 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I heard something like that
L650272 +++$+++ u8886 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ DEZERAE +++$+++ You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
L650271 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
L650269 +++$+++ u8886 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ DEZERAE +++$+++ As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
L650268 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
L650267 +++$+++ u8886 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ DEZERAE +++$+++ Don't give me shit - what do you want?
L650266 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ The one on the left - definitely...
L650265 +++$+++ u8886 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ DEZERAE +++$+++ Which do you think is her best shot...
L650733 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yes - I have had it for years.
L650732 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ This must be one of the old keys -
L650728 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
L650727 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
L650726 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
L650725 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
L650723 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ No - I've been abroad for a long time...
L650722 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
L650674 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
L650673 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ No - not all the time - I mean
L650672 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ All the time?
L650671 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
L650670 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
L650668 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
L650667 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ And it can't be forged?
L650666 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ That's right...
L650665 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ So there is only one key...
L650664 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
L650663 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
L650662 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Yes it is...
L650661 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
L650656 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
L650655 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ BRIAN...
L650654 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
L650653 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
L650652 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ When could I look round?
L650650 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
L650649 +++$+++ u8887 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ CHIC MAGAZINE?
L650648 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
L650748 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ No - I'll have you after
L650747 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Don't you want me now LESLIE
L650744 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ It's what you would do to me
L650743 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
L650740 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You killed my friend!
L650739 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
L650713 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ WAIT FOR WHAT!?
L650712 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
L650711 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
L650701 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
L650700 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
L650697 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Why whats wrong with the sugar -
L650696 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
L650695 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
L650694 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I don't like sugar
L650692 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ What was I supposed to do?
L650691 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Why did you let him in?
L650687 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ He doesn't need to...
L650686 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ First finish your tea...
L650679 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ No thanks - 
L650678 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
L650643 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Yes - I suppose so...
L650642 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
L650641 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I am sorry...
L650640 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
L650639 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
L650638 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ We've got nothing to talk about
L650635 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Out - I may be some time
L650634 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Where are you going?
L650632 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
L650631 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
L650630 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
L650629 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Yes...
L650627 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Open it...
L650626 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What is it?
L650624 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
L650623 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What's wrong?
L650567 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Nothing could be better...
L650566 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ What's wrong?
L650565 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
L650564 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
L650563 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
L650562 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What?
L650560 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Then make it stop...
L650559 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I want it to stop - it all to stop...
L650558 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
L650557 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
L650556 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
L650555 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
L650554 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
L650553 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ STEPHANIE?
L650552 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
L650550 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Did you?
L650549 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
L650546 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
L650545 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
L650537 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
L650536 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ And how did it feel to be rid of him
L650531 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Why not? Please - it would help me
L650530 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Why should I?
L650529 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Tell me how it happened...
L650527 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
L650526 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ You've killed but you're not a killer
L650525 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
L650524 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
L650520 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
L650519 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What didn't you like about her?
L650518 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
L650517 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ then why did you marry her -
L650516 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
L650515 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Tell me about your wife...
L650514 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I have something I have to show you...
L650513 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ How long have you been watching me?
L650492 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
L650491 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
L650490 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
L650489 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
L650488 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I don't know...
L650487 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
L650486 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I don't know...
L650485 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
L650484 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it -
L650483 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
L650482 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
L650481 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What did you do with her?
L650480 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ No she didn't...
L650479 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
L650478 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
L650477 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I don't know
L650476 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
L650475 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
L650474 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Where do you kill them...
L650473 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
L650472 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You don't know?
L650471 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I don't know
L650470 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ And how many people have you killed?
L650469 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Oh, about six years since I graduated
L650468 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ And how long have you been a dentist?
L650467 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I'm a dentist
L650466 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ So what do you do?
L650457 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Yes, one and a half please.
L650456 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Sugar?
L650436 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I think I will pass...

L650335 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Don't worry - Is that my hammer  Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
L650334 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
L650333 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ My names isn't ANGELA...
L650332 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
L650331 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What's with all the locks - and hammering

L650325 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Do you take sugar?
L650322 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ The touch?
L650321 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I lost the touch
L650317 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Tell me - ELLEN CARTER  Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book - 'The Color of Fear'?

L650315 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
L650294 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I really don't know what to say
L650293 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ It doesn't mention 'females only'
L650757 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ He saved my life you know - has he told you...
L650756 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ No he had to - he's just - he's out...
L650755 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ Is LESLIE here?
L650754 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
L650753 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ What happened?
L650450 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm your landlady
L650449 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?

L650444 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
L650443 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You heard me - keep away from him
L650442 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ What?
L650441 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
L650440 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ What's wrong with you?
L650303 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
L650302 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
L650301 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
L650300 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Well, what do you think?
L650286 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ At 2.00...
L650285 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
L650685 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I think you had better leave
L650684 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
L650384 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Get out...
L650383 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
L650382 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ At home alone - where were you?
L650381 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
L650380 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
L650379 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
L650378 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What brings the rats out of the sewers?
L650375 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
L650374 +++$+++ u8885 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What's this all about?
L650373 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ It's been what, three years?
L650579 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Yes - of course.
L650578 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
L650577 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
L650576 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
L650575 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ That's good
L650572 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Yes, come on in...
L650571 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
L650570 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I thought it was you - how are you?
L650324 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Oh...
L650323 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ Her husband left her
L650319 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
L650318 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
L650314 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ Don't worry about it -
L650313 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
L650308 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ No worries
L650307 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Just put it in my room
L650297 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ No - a dentist
L650296 +++$+++ u8888 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ MIK +++$+++ Surgery? Are you a doctor?
L650295 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
L650682 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
L650681 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ ANGEL...
L650677 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Yes - one please.
L650676 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Sugar?
L650595 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
L650594 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
L650592 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ I'll be sure to...
L650591 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
L650590 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
L650589 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ So she didn't mention anything more about it?
L650588 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
L650587 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Dead?
L650582 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
L650581 +++$+++ u8889 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ STECKLER +++$+++ Yes...?
L650580 +++$+++ u8890 +++$+++ m604 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Dr STECKLER?
L652759 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
L652758 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You got everything you ever wanted.
L652694 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
L652693 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
L652692 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
L652544 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
L652543 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Get them together.
L652493 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I love those springy head puppies!
L652492 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
L652491 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
L652490 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
L652487 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
L652486 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I thought I loved her.
L652423 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
L652422 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
L652417 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
L652416 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You'll never believe who's in there.
L652415 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
L652414 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're late, bro!
L652133 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
L652132 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
L652128 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Give me those!
L652127 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
L652126 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
L652125 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Take a whiff of heaven.
L652124 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh, how inappropriate is that!
L652122 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
L652121 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
L652120 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
L652119 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
L652118 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
L652117 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ And some really fast cars.
L652116 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
L652115 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
L652114 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Dead?
L652113 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
L652112 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
L652111 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
L652110 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Check it out!
L652109 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What is it now?
L652108 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hurry.
L652106 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I better go, Dad.
L652105 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Check this out.  Hurry!
L652092 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, whatever.
L652091 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ So far away? In Xenia?
L652090 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
L652089 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You kiss your mother with that mouth?
L652082 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Not ever. Never.
L652081 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
L652080 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
L652079 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
L652076 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
L652075 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
L652051 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Perv.
L652050 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
L652019 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
L652018 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
L652017 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
L652015 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
L652014 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Cut it out, before you break something!
L652013 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
L652011 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Maybe he got promoted.
L652010 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...A bouncer? Are you serious?
L652009 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well, Dad said...
L652008 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Who the hell was your father?
L652005 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Astronomical.
L652004 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
L652001 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding...
L652000 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
L651999 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
L651998 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
L651997 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
L651996 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
L651995 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
L651889 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
L651888 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
L651887 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I defy any and all limits.
L651886 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's crazy talk.
L651885 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
L651884 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
L651883 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Someday, I'll find out.
L651882 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
L651881 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Were you always this sick?
L651880 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
L651879 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
L651878 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ See? Did you see that?
L651877 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
L651876 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
L651873 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
L651872 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
L651871 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You and your pep talks.
L651870 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
L652174 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ God, I love being dead.
L652173 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
L652172 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ These are real, live women?
L652171 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
L652170 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Let me get this straight...
L652169 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
L652084 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, god.  Look. Look.
L652083 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Never say never.
L652071 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
L652070 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
L652749 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ He kicked major ass and you know it.
L652748 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
L652268 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Jealousy is so unattractive.
L652267 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
L652266 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
L652265 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
L652264 +++$+++ u8891 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We reinvented ourselves.
L652263 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ What gives, Don Corleone?
L652675 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
L652674 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ God, you are so hot.
L652673 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?
L652672 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
L652671 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
L652666 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
L652665 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
L652664 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I mean, what do you think?
L652663 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You have changed since second grade.
L652662 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Well?
L652661 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
L652660 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
L652659 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
L652657 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That was code for "I like you."
L652656 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Which you pulled, hard!
L652655 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
L652654 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You know...take the pictures?
L652653 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Do it?
L652652 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
L652651 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
L652650 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
L652421 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
L652420 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
L652419 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Hi, Teddy Bear.
L652286 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
L652285 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah? You like?
L652284 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
L651921 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
L651920 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ So that's a maybe?
L651919 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
L651918 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ So you'll think about it?
L651917 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
L651916 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ But that smile.
L651915 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
L651914 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
L651913 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Ted, have you lost your mind?
L651867 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
L651866 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
L651865 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ If you don't have...I mean...
L651864 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah?
L651863 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ And I was wondering.
L651862 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah?
L651861 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Well. The prom's coming up.
L651860 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Ladies first.  I insist.
L651859 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You go first.
L651858 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ From your lips, to God's ears.
L651857 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
L652445 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
L652444 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
L652442 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We miss our family.
L652441 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We miss you. We miss our son.
L652440 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
L652437 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
L652436 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
L652435 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
L652331 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We love our lives just the way they are.
L652330 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
L652329 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
L652250 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
L652249 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
L652248 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Sweetheart, what is it?
L652243 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
L652242 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
L651956 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We own a small family grocery store.
L651955 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
L652725 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I will not have my boys arguing.
L652724 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
L652448 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
L652447 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Watch your tone, mister.
L652446 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
L652439 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ You ordered a Winnebago?
L652438 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
L652431 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
L652430 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's okay. You need me?
L652429 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Sorry I--
L652326 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
L652325 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
L652313 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
L652312 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Finally, some gratitude.
L652104 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Well, good. Every little bit helps.
L652103 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
L652102 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
L652101 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Just say it, Dad.
L652100 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
L651992 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ ...not the pit.
L651991 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
L651990 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
L651989 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Whatever helps you cope.
L651988 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
L651987 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
L651986 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
L651985 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
L651984 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah.
L651983 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
L651982 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess.
L651981 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
L651980 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well, why should I?
L651979 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Son.
L651978 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
L651977 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Of course we are.
L651976 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You guys are my parents.
L651975 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I'm getting so good at this.
L651974 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
L651973 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ The lesson being?
L651972 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
L651971 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ You're way ahead of me again?
L651970 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
L651969 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
L651968 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Dad, please.
L651967 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
L651937 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's my private business! Mine!
L651936 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
L652481 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
L652480 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Well?
L652479 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hang in there, I'll think of something.
L652478 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
L652477 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L652476 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Ted! Do something!
L652460 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Of course we were.
L652459 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
L652453 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Whatever you want.
L652452 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
L652451 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hmmm?
L652450 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Teddy? I was thinking.
L652167 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
L652166 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I always knew there was more. I felt it.
L652165 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
L652163 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ And who IS Ted Nelson?
L652162 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
L652161 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Who exactly ARE you?
L652158 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hi ho, Silver.
L652157 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
L652156 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
L652155 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
L652153 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
L652152 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ That's me.
L652151 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ The one with the horses.
L652150 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
L652149 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
L652148 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
L652147 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Some of them have to be automatics.
L652146 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ It's your car. These are all your cars.
L652145 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
L652144 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
L652142 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Got it.
L652141 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
L652139 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Want a lesson?
L652138 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
L652137 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You do know how to drive?
L652136 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ They're in the ignition, silly.
L652135 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I-I don't have the keys.
L652048 +++$+++ u8903 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Everything.
L652047 +++$+++ u8895 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
L652046 +++$+++ u8903 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
L652045 +++$+++ u8895 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Can you believe that was me?
L652044 +++$+++ u8903 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
L652043 +++$+++ u8895 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
L652042 +++$+++ u8903 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
L652041 +++$+++ u8895 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
L652040 +++$+++ u8903 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
L652039 +++$+++ u8895 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
L652717 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
L652716 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
L652715 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I understand.
L652714 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
L652713 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
L652712 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My legacy.
L652711 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
L652710 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
L652709 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
L652708 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You mean they knew who I was?
L652707 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
L652699 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
L652698 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
L652433 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
L652432 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
L652030 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
L652029 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're on the next plane home.
L652380 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
L652379 +++$+++ u8897 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
L652378 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
L652377 +++$+++ u8897 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
L652376 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
L652375 +++$+++ u8897 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
L652374 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
L652373 +++$+++ u8897 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
L652757 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
L652756 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Great.
L652595 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
L652594 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I didn't forget.
L652593 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
L652592 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
L652591 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's a crappy thing to say.
L652590 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I meant biologically.
L652589 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He was my Grandfather, too.
L652588 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
L652587 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're a peach.
L652586 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
L652585 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I miss them, too.
L652584 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
L652583 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Are they okay?
L652582 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
L652581 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
L652580 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Just a formality.
L652579 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You want it in writing?
L652578 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ If you could just sign right there.
L652577 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
L652576 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
L652575 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's not up to me.
L652574 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
L652573 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My room?
L652572 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
L652571 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Very funny.
L652570 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ My new bike.
L652569 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ So, what brings you here at his hour?
L652568 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
L652567 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Most places are, Jimmy.
L652566 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
L652564 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
L652563 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
L652562 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
L652561 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
L652560 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ James, what are you doing here?
L651931 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
L651930 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
L652775 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You better.
L652774 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
L652773 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Let your fingers do the walking.
L652772 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yellow pages?
L652771 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
L652770 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
L652769 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
L652767 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
L652766 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
L652765 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Very ambitious. I like that.
L652764 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
L652763 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.
L652762 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
L652761 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
L652648 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
L652647 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
L652646 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You think you're working with chimps here?
L652645 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're quick. I like that.
L652644 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
L652643 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
L652642 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
L652641 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
L652640 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
L652639 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
L652638 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
L652634 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ But absolutely true.
L652633 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ That's hard to believe.
L652632 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
L652631 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Maybe someday.
L652630 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I want you to trust me.
L652629 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
L652628 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Come on.
L652627 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Not a chance.
L652626 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Do you trust me, Julie?
L652625 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
L652624 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
L652623 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
L652622 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
L652621 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
L652620 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I see.
L652619 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
L652618 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Tell me more.
L652617 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm very aural.
L652616 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What about you?
L652615 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ That's refreshingly deviant.
L652614 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
L652613 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Wearing them?  Or humping them?
L652612 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
L652611 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
L652610 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
L652609 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
L652608 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That has more to do with your proximity to me.
L652607 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm trembling with excitement.
L652606 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
L652605 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Amen to that.
L652604 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
L652603 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
L652602 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
L652601 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Let's do it.
L652600 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
L652599 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He's on the move?
L652598 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Well? Where the hell are you?
L652597 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's probably my office.
L652535 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
L652534 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
L652533 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
L652532 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
L652531 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
L652530 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
L652529 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
L652528 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
L652527 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
L652526 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ But you never do.
L652525 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
L652524 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I know.
L652523 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're amazing.
L652522 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
L652521 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ And then what?
L652520 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Eventually you'll let go.
L652519 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
L652518 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It's incredibly simple.
L652517 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's all so complicated.
L652516 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
L652515 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I mean my father.
L652514 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Your dad taught you everything.
L652513 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
L652512 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
L652511 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
L652510 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I doubt it.
L652509 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I see.
L652508 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ He phoned it in.
L652507 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He cared enough to want you to have it.
L652506 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
L652505 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Whatever.
L652504 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ He didn't. He had it built.
L652503 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I can't believe your dad built this for you.
L652502 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ To the best hiding place in the world.
L652501 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Where are we going?
L652458 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
L652457 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Wow...you clean up nice.
L652371 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You've got enough people kissing your ass.
L652370 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Why can't you be nice to me?
L652369 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
L652368 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
L652367 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
L652366 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
L652365 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well? What do you think of her?
L652357 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ A little respect would be nice, that's all.
L652356 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
L652355 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
L652354 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
L652353 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
L652352 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
L652351 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
L652350 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
L652349 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Funny you should say "peachy."
L652348 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
L652347 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
L652346 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Is this an gritty expos顯r a candy ass press release?
L652345 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Don't write that part.
L652344 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You never know around here.
L652343 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ She said peanuts, you cretin.
L652340 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Interesting.
L652339 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess.
L652338 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
L652337 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
L652336 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
L652335 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't get the distinction.
L652334 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
L652333 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I have to admit, I always felt... different.
L652304 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Really? You wanna write about me?
L652303 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ "Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
L652302 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Me?
L652301 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Then I'll write about YOU.
L652300 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
L652298 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's not ENTIRELY true.
L652297 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
L652296 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm trying to help.
L652295 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
L652294 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
L652293 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
L652292 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
L652291 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ In what sense?
L652290 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Your article sucked.
L652289 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
L652288 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
L652287 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
L651926 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
L651925 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ But you triple-dog-dared me.
L651924 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
L651909 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ --Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
L651908 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I have absolutely no intention--
L651907 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
L651906 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Me-ow.
L651905 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
L651904 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
L651903 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
L651902 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
L651901 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
L651900 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning expos顣hanged all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
L651899 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
L651898 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
L651897 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
L652730 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
L652729 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
L652719 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
L652718 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
L652328 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Forget the store. Think big.
L652327 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ But who would run the store?
L652324 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
L652323 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Like what?
L652322 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
L652321 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Oh. Goodness.
L652320 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
L652318 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ But how would we pay our bills?
L652317 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You don't have to work another day in your lives.
L652261 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'll make you very proud.
L652260 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You promise you'll finish school?
L652259 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Only the best for my mother.
L652258 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
L652256 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
L652255 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
L652254 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
L652253 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ What is all this? When are you coming home?
L652252 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well? Surprised?
L652099 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
L652098 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
L652097 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
L652096 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
L652095 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
L651966 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
L651965 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
L651960 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
L651959 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ That's part of growing up, honey.
L651935 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
L651934 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
L651933 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
L652499 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
L652498 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You called the cops on us?
L652497 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
L652496 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
L652495 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
L652494 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
L652473 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
L652472 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ I'm warning you.
L652471 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
L652470 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
L652466 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
L652465 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Come on, it's our only senior prom.
L652464 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ Rules are rules.
L652463 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
L652400 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
L652399 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
L652398 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
L652282 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
L652281 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
L652280 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
L652279 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ I never figured you for a pimp.
L652278 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
L652277 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
L652276 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
L652275 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
L652274 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
L652273 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
L652272 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Thanks, Principal Merkin.
L652271 +++$+++ u8901 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL MERKIN +++$+++ I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
L652744 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
L652743 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
L652742 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
L652741 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
L652737 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My job. Back off, Benedict.
L652736 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L652735 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ --PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
L652734 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
L652688 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
L652687 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yes?
L652559 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
L652558 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
L652557 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
L652556 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
L652554 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
L652553 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
L652552 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
L652551 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.
L652550 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Seriously? I'm doing all right?
L652549 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
L652548 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
L652547 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I can't wait to see the pictures.
L652546 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
L652428 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ He was in a league of his own.
L652427 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My father must've been amazing.
L652425 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Really? So I'm doing OK?
L652424 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
L652226 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
L652225 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
L652221 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's perfect.
L652220 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
L652219 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ In other words, our scope is too narrow.
L652218 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
L652217 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You think we should be more open minded?
L652216 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
L652215 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What kind of ideas?
L652214 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
L652213 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My parents always say hard work builds character.
L652212 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
L652211 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
L652210 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
L652209 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Really? You'd do that for me?
L652208 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
L652207 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
L652206 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
L652205 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
L652204 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You were the new and improved you.
L652203 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I was like a different person tonight.
L652202 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I told you you could do it.
L652199 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Why, look who's here.
L652198 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
L652197 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
L652196 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Me? The King of Coitus?
L652195 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
L652193 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
L652192 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I do?
L652191 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
L652190 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
L652189 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
L652188 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
L652187 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ They said that? Really?  Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.
L652186 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
L652185 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
L652184 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah.  Everything's cool.
L652183 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
L652180 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Tipping?
L652179 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
L652087 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
L652086 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
L652073 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
L652072 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
L652067 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Seldom? No kidding?
L652066 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
L652063 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You're sure?
L652062 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ As much as possible.
L652061 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
L652060 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Of course I like girls.
L652059 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ You do like girls, don't you?
L652058 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ I have only one concern...
L652057 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
L652056 +++$+++ u8904 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ UNCLE BILLY +++$+++ Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
L652036 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?
L652035 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
L652034 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
L651958 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
L651957 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ How quaint.
L651953 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
L651952 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
L651951 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
L651950 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My parents? What do you mean?
L651949 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ It's about your parents.
L651948 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
L651947 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ I'm just a messenger.
L651946 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ People pay good money for that?
L651945 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ Bad news.
L651944 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
L651943 +++$+++ u8905 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ ZUKERMAN +++$+++ In a hurry, are we?
L655070 +++$+++ u8906 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ I... You know... I...
L655069 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How you doing, Artie?
L654862 +++$+++ u8906 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
L654861 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
L654860 +++$+++ u8906 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
L654859 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This is insane.
L654858 +++$+++ u8906 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
L654857 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ ... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
L654856 +++$+++ u8906 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ Kelly Van Ryan...
L654855 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Talk to me Artie.
L654690 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
L654689 +++$+++ u8906 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
L655226 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'd like that.
L655225 +++$+++ u8907 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
L655224 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
L655223 +++$+++ u8907 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ And where might that be?
L655222 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
L655219 +++$+++ u8907 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Thanks.
L655218 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You look pretty.
L654747 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
L654746 +++$+++ u8907 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ She's going to wash your Jeep?
L654745 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Kelly.
L654744 +++$+++ u8907 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
L654737 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Eat a power bar.
L654736 +++$+++ u8907 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
L655305 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
L655304 +++$+++ u8908 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
L655303 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What about the blood?
L655302 +++$+++ u8908 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
L655301 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The teeth doin' any talkin'?
L655300 +++$+++ u8908 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Merritt, Forensics.
L655289 +++$+++ u8908 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
L655288 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ How soon can we get something?
L655432 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I'm fine.  Nice TV.
L655431 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ You okay?
L655429 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
L655428 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
L655427 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
L655426 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
L655425 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
L655424 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ And the child...
L655423 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
L655387 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Was there ever any kind of investigation...
L655386 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
L655385 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ She still work there?
L655384 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
L655383 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
L655382 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
L655381 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ About Suzie?
L655380 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
L655379 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
L655378 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
L655377 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
L655376 +++$+++ u8915 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
L654834 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
L654833 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Try, Kelly.
L654832 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
L654831 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You mean he withdrew...
L654830 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
L654829 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Then what?
L654828 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
L654827 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Did you try to fight him?
L654826 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ He was large?
L654825 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
L654824 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
L654823 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
L654822 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
L654821 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
L654820 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I understand.
L654819 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ They were in me.  Both places... you know.
L654818 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Take your time.
L654817 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
L654813 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I know you do.
L654812 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
L654811 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
L655332 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Suzie?
L655331 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
L655327 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You could tell me where you were last night.
L655326 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know what to say...
L655325 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Ray thinks she was murdered.
L655324 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Maybe she used another name.
L655323 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
L655322 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How long?
L655321 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Suzie Toller is missing.
L655320 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
L654920 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
L654919 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Weren't you a little worried about her...?
L654918 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L654917 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
L654914 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
L654913 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
L654694 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I'd like that.
L654693 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
L655342 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
L655341 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
L655340 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
L655339 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Where's Lombardo?
L655338 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
L655299 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
L655298 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
L655297 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
L655296 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
L655295 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Ray, you heard him...
L655294 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Will you do me one favor?
L655291 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ We don't know that, Ray...
L655290 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
L655286 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You don't think Sam could've put it there?
L655285 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
L655284 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
L655283 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Where's the body?
L655282 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
L655281 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
L655262 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Just check out the car.
L655261 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ If you want company...
L655260 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You have someplace to be?
L655259 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
L655258 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
L655257 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
L655217 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
L655216 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ We all have...
L655215 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
L655214 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You could say that.
L655213 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Guess I kind of lost it there.
L655206 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
L655205 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
L655126 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I net a guy in a bar.
L655125 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
L655124 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
L655123 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Eliminate the competition.
L655122 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
L655121 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
L655120 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
L655119 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
L655117 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
L655116 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
L655115 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
L655114 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
L655113 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Unless what?
L655112 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
L655111 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
L655110 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
L655107 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Lombardo's settlement?
L655106 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You saw the news today?
L654954 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
L654953 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
L654952 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
L654951 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
L654950 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ The skinny brunette.
L654949 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
L654947 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
L654946 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
L654942 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
L654941 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You're telling me you believe the guy?
L654940 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
L654936 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
L654935 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
L654851 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
L654850 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's our job, Gloria.
L654845 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
L654844 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
L654692 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Back to the land of grownups.
L654691 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I've got that two o'clock in town.
L655003 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
L655002 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ What was that?
L655001 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ He did say something.
L654999 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
L654998 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ At that point were you able to fight him off?
L654987 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I guess.
L654986 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Did he come in with you?
L654985 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Yes.
L654984 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ So you were alone.
L654983 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ No.
L654982 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
L654981 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L654980 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ He dropped Jimmy off first?
L654979 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ About a year ago.
L654978 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
L654977 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
L654974 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Why is that?
L654973 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Yeah, maybe, a little.
L654972 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ That bothers you?
L654848 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
L654847 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
L654846 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ I want a full-scale investigation.
L654843 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
L654842 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Where's this coming from?
L654841 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
L654838 +++$+++ u8909 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
L654837 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Why?
L655362 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
L655361 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The teeth, were they...
L655359 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
L655358 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ You didn't cuff her?
L655357 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
L655356 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
L655355 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ She bit you?
L655353 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
L655352 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Just tell us what happened.
L655351 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
L655293 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
L655292 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Kelly's next, Gloria.
L655209 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
L655208 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Oh, Ray... no...
L655204 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
L655203 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
L655202 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
L655201 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Are you crazy, Ray?
L654934 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ And what do they say?
L654933 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
L654932 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ What about witnesses?
L654931 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
L654840 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
L654839 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
L655037 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Your Honor... Please...
L655036 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
L655026 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ I'm sorry?
L655025 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ This wasn't my idea.
L655024 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
L655023 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I said he did.
L655022 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Ms. Toller?
L655020 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
L655019 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
L655018 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
L654997 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
L654996 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
L654995 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
L654994 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ What did you do then?
L654991 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I wanna go home now.
L654990 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
L654989 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Yeah... okay... he did
L654988 +++$+++ u8910 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ HUNTER +++$+++ You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
L654711 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah.  But I got my bike.
L654710 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ A ride.  You want one?
L654709 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What?
L654708 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
L654700 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
L654699 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
L654674 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
L654673 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thank you, Jimmy.
L654672 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ No!
L654671 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
L655277 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah, but...
L655276 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
L655275 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
L655274 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I say something funny?
L655273 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Lombardo ever come out here?
L655272 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
L655271 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You and Suzie used to come out here together?
L655270 +++$+++ u8911 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It's those rocks, up there.
L655235 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Shit.
L655234 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I wanna live at the beach someday.
L655233 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I think we just need to get wasted.
L655232 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I thought we were goin' to a movie.
L655231 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Nothing.
L655230 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ What are you looking at?
L655229 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ What brain?
L655228 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
L655195 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
L655194 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ You are.
L655193 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Oh, for Christ's sake.
L655192 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
L655174 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You can trust me.
L655173 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
L655172 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
L655145 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
L655144 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
L655143 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
L655142 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
L655253 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm not on your property!
L655252 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Get off my property.
L655138 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Police -- God -- get a life.
L655137 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
L655136 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
L655135 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You're out of your mind.
L655134 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
L655133 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
L655132 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Excuse me?
L655130 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
L655129 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Curiosity, I guess.
L655128 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Is there some reason why you're here?
L655269 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ A friend of mine bought a boat.
L655268 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Where, the mall?
L655267 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
L655266 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
L655265 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
L654802 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yes.  God, Mom...
L654801 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ He... Sam Lombardo?
L654800 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
L654799 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ What?
L654794 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
L654793 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ No you don't.
L654792 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
L654791 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I miss Dad.
L654790 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Kelly.  What is it?
L654788 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ No thanks to you.
L654787 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I would hardly say you look like trash.
L654786 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
L654785 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You notice my new jumper?
L654784 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Okay, what's the matter?
L654783 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Whichever one I want.
L654782 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
L654720 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Sam!  Hi!
L654719 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Hi, Mon.
L654718 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Is that Sam Lombardo?
L655455 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
L655454 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You think that's wise?
L655453 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm running away.
L655441 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ No little girl can ever make me come.
L655440 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I love you.  Now give me the line.
L655439 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Say you love me.
L655438 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's not your line.
L655437 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
L655319 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Okay.  I love you too.
L655318 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
L655317 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
L655316 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
L655315 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I don't know.  I want to see you...
L655314 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And you believe her?
L655313 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
L655312 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
L655311 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
L655310 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Duquette.  Forget him...
L655309 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
L655308 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ God, I've been calling you.
L655307 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hello.
L655306 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Hello?
L655248 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
L655247 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
L655186 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
L655185 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm here.
L655181 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
L655180 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You know what it takes.
L655179 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
L655178 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Why can't you come...
L655177 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
L655176 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yes.
L655175 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
L655105 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Stick?
L655104 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We have to stick with the plan.
L655103 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Do it to ourselves?
L655102 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
L655100 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
L655099 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
L655095 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
L655094 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
L655089 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ About six and a half million dollars.
L655088 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ How much?
L655086 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ So you got my mom's money.
L655085 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
L655074 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
L655073 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
L655072 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Kelly...
L654754 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
L654753 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ All right.  I'll have to look for it.
L654752 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
L654751 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
L654750 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
L654749 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So, where you off to now?
L654743 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ In back of the garage.
L654742 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Where's the hose?  We can set up.
L654740 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
L654739 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
L654717 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I won't.
L654716 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Don't forget the car wash.
L654706 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
L654705 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
L655046 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
L655045 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Just like that?
L655044 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
L655043 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
L655042 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Come on, let loose!
L654899 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
L654898 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I just want my life back...
L654897 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
L654896 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ There's nothing for them to get.
L654895 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
L654894 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Nellie Gail Ranch...
L654893 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
L654892 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L654891 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
L654890 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
L654889 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Can't you take that stupid thing off?
L654888 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
L654887 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
L654886 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Forget it.
L654885 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
L654884 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Good thinking.
L654868 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
L654867 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ But check this...
L655350 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
L655349 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ You can't...
L655348 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
L655347 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
L655346 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Where is she?
L655345 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
L655344 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Who is it?
L654805 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ That's right.
L654804 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
L655406 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
L655405 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sam, for godsake.
L655402 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
L655401 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
L655168 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's right.  That was his name.
L655167 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Davy.
L655164 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Shut up.
L655163 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
L655162 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Get away from me.
L655159 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
L655158 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
L655157 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
L655156 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
L655155 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You, Kelly, Sam.
L655154 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
L655153 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
L655152 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ About what?
L655151 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
L655150 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ That's cop bullshit.
L655149 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
L655148 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ You got something against cigarettes?
L655147 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
L654971 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
L654970 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It doesn't look like it.
L654969 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Will they?
L654968 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No.
L654966 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ So Suzie, you called us, remember?
L654965 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
L654963 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I did.  At Blue Balls.
L654962 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
L655397 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Come off it, man... It was an accident.
L655396 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
L655395 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jesus, man... You okay?
L655394 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, or get me drowned.
L655393 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
L655392 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
L655391 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
L655390 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You mean this thing?
L655373 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
L655372 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
L655371 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
L655370 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
L655369 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The bitch shot me, is what happened.
L655368 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
L654925 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sit down, Lombardo.
L654924 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
L654923 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
L654922 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
L654921 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
L654916 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's right.
L654915 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ But she ran away.
L654912 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
L654911 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
L654910 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
L654909 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
L654908 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes.
L654907 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And she wanted to talk.
L654906 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes.
L654905 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
L654904 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
L654903 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The one you bought at school.
L654902 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I had to go look for this coupon.
L654901 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Story's the same, Detective...
L654900 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
L655452 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
L655451 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
L655450 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How...
L655449 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
L655448 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We?
L655447 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
L655444 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
L655443 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
L655442 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
L655420 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
L655419 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's wrong?
L655415 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That was the same thing Ray said.
L655414 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ What?
L655413 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
L655412 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
L655411 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
L655410 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That was about as grim as it gets.
L655242 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
L655241 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Are you mad at me?
L655240 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
L655191 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
L655190 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L655188 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
L655187 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ But I..
L655184 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Put Kelly on too.
L655183 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Sam...
L655097 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
L655096 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
L654778 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Goodbye, Sandra.
L654777 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
L654775 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
L654774 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
L654772 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
L654771 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Didn't you see her this morning?
L654770 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Shit. Here we go again.
L654769 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L654768 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
L654767 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sandy... What's up?
L654730 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
L654729 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
L654728 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
L654727 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
L654726 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
L654724 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Can't.  Got a passenger.
L654723 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Why don't you come in, have a drink?
L654722 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hi, Sandy.
L654721 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
L657170 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ I'm sure we will.
L657169 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
L657163 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
L657162 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ What is this?  A whole new train?
L657161 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
L657151 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ In the next two minutes?
L657150 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
L657149 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
L657148 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
L657121 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Oh, I see, an easy plan!
L657120 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
L657115 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where have you been?
L657114 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ My God!  He's so excessive!
L657078 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
L657077 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ God in heaven, what is that?!
L657070 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Thank you.
L657069 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ My hat is off to you, sir.
L657066 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Of course not.
L657065 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Are those just button buttons or...?
L657064 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
L657063 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ It was in your book.
L657058 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
L657057 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ There's only seventy-eight.
L657056 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
L657055 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
L657054 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
L657053 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I know!  I know!
L657052 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ What?  President Grant is...!
L657051 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
L657002 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ My pleasure.
L657001 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh, thank you.
L657000 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
L656996 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
L656995 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
L656983 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
L656982 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ When we find him, he is mine.
L656980 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
L656979 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
L656978 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ I adjusted it.
L656977 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Not again.
L656976 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
L656975 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And people are actually fooled by that?
L656974 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
L656973 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What is that?
L656971 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
L656970 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Relax.  We're almost there.
L656969 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
L656968 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
L656967 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
L656966 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ It's a town!
L656965 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's not a guy...
L656964 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Willard...
L656955 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
L656954 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
L656953 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ What's this?
L656952 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
L656951 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No record of him.
L656950 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
L656949 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ It is?
L656948 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's better than nothing.
L656947 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Oh, damn!  That's it.
L656945 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
L656944 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ This is good.
L656938 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
L656937 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
L656936 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Know what this is?
L656898 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
L656897 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
L656896 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Thank you.
L656895 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
L656894 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Can you fill me in here?
L656884 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
L656883 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ They're so precious when they're asleep.
L656881 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
L656880 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
L656879 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
L656878 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You might have mentioned you had that.
L656874 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
L656873 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Uh... how long ago was this?
L656872 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
L656871 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ So... what happened?
L656870 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
L656869 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Well... that, too.
L656868 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ "Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
L656867 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
L656866 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What way is that?
L656865 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
L656864 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
L656863 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
L656862 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Jim, are you all right?
L656858 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ That's right... That's good.
L656857 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
L656856 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Damn it, this is ridiculous.
L656855 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Hey, I tried the board.
L656854 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ At least I tried something.
L656850 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ It's a repeating steam cannon!
L656849 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Never seen a gun fire so fast!
L656848 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm going to hit you.
L656847 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
L656845 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
L656844 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
L656835 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
L656834 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ All that jumping and kicking.
L656833 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ All what?
L656832 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ What was all that back there?
L656811 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
L656810 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
L656809 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Now, what was that?
L656808 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
L656807 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You feeling all right?
L656806 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Yes.  Now, observe....
L656805 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Almost?
L656804 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
L656800 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
L656799 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
L656798 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
L656797 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
L656720 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
L656719 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
L656718 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's a lot of butler.
L656716 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
L656715 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
L656714 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
L656712 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ My disguise.  And here...
L656711 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Prepare what?
L656710 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
L656709 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
L656708 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
L656707 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Limestone quarry?
L656697 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What about the explosive?
L656696 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
L656695 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Starting with a screw?
L656694 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
L656693 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Is this leading somewhere?
L656692 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
L656691 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Aha?
L656690 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Aha!
L656667 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ I'll work on it.
L656666 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That should put us ahead of the criminals.
L656663 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
L656662 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
L656661 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Try what?
L656660 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
L656659 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
L656658 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
L656657 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Always hoping.  Or this...
L656656 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You need that real often?
L656655 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
L656653 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ "Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
L656652 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
L656651 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
L656650 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ "Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
L656649 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
L656648 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
L656647 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Put them all together and what do we have?
L656646 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
L656645 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Wouldn't dream of it.
L656644 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But don't pull that again.
L656632 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
L656631 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
L656630 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
L656629 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
L656628 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
L656627 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
L656626 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
L656625 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Funny.  So am I.
L656624 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
L656623 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
L656622 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
L656621 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Jim West.
L656620 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ J. S. Bach.
L657107 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
L657106 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
L657088 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
L657087 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ He's not giving up?
L657080 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ But it only has six legs.
L657079 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ He calls it the Tarantula.
L657060 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ My Lord, he was telling the truth!
L657059 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ You didn't tell us you had this on!
L656824 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
L656823 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ Yes, me!
L656822 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
L657095 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
L657094 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ They don't even realize they should be frightened.
L657093 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ I could get used to this, looking down on people.
L656762 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
L656761 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
L656760 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Anyone?
L656749 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ We'll see.
L656748 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ A new friend?
L657128 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Fine, I'll stop.
L657127 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
L656910 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
L656909 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You bring the best out in a man.
L656908 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ My.  It's gotten longer.
L656905 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
L656904 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ She's perfectly safe.
L656789 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I've had some practice.
L656788 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ You've... done... this... before.
L656787 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh, I would hope not.
L656786 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Would that include me?
L656785 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
L656782 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
L656781 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
L656780 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
L656779 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
L656778 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You tell me.
L656777 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
L656774 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't like to lose, either.
L656773 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
L656743 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ You most certainly do.
L656742 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, I owe you one, don't I?
L656741 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
L656740 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
L656739 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Your guests, ma'am?
L656738 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
L656735 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ My... the wild west.
L656734 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
L656733 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Really?
L656732 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
L656731 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
L656730 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
L656729 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
L656728 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
L657105 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
L657104 +++$+++ u8921 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
L656618 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ My friend?
L656617 +++$+++ u8921 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
L656616 +++$+++ u8921 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
L656615 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Private train?
L656614 +++$+++ u8921 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Your private train, sir.
L656613 +++$+++ u8921 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
L656612 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Look, I'm Captain James West...
L656594 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
L656593 +++$+++ u8926 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ RICHARDS +++$+++ Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
L656584 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
L656583 +++$+++ u8926 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ RICHARDS +++$+++ Yes sir.
L656582 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ French?
L656581 +++$+++ u8926 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ RICHARDS +++$+++ Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
L656580 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
L656579 +++$+++ u8926 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ RICHARDS +++$+++ Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
L656578 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
L656963 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
L656962 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where'd he say he was going to do this?
L656958 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ On my way to Denver...
L656957 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ ... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
L656607 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ And now the job's yours.
L656606 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And?
L656605 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
L656604 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
L656603 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nicely said, sir.
L656602 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
L656601 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
L656600 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
L656592 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nice to finally meet you, sir.
L656591 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ This is Colonel Richards.
L656590 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Good work.  Really.
L656589 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That'll be all, boys.
L656588 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
L657140 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
L657139 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Easy now.
L657027 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
L657026 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
L657025 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
L657024 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ The first.
L657023 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ "Emperor Miguelito...?"
L657022 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ I've even printed my own currency.
L657019 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
L657018 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That would be... the Mexican War?
L657017 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
L657016 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
L657015 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
L657013 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
L657012 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
L657011 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
L657010 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Philistine.
L657009 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He had a pressing engagement.
L657008 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
L657006 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
L657005 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're not that big.
L656940 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dr. Loveless?
L656939 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ ... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
L656927 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
L656926 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
L656769 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
L656768 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
L656766 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I deal with some tough customers.
L656765 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
L656764 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, sir... just a businessman.
L656763 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
L656757 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
L656756 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
L656754 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
L656753 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I admire a man with a sense of humor.
L657076 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
L657075 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L657042 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ It is?
L657041 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Now it's a bomb.
L657040 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ It's a smelting retort.
L657039 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ This is something.
L657038 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
L657037 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
L657034 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
L657033 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Are you all right?
L656843 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
L656842 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
L656841 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Who was this partner of his?
L656840 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
L656831 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We'll explain on the way.
L656830 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ Who were they?  What do they want with me?
L656829 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
L656819 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ Yes!
L656818 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dr. Pemberton?
L656549 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Right.
L656548 +++$+++ u8927 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ WALTERS +++$+++ Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
L656547 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're not going to use it, are you?
L656546 +++$+++ u8927 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ WALTERS +++$+++ Hey...!
L656545 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ In an hour they're gone!
L656544 +++$+++ u8927 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ WALTERS +++$+++ They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
L656543 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ When are they coming?
L656542 +++$+++ u8927 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ WALTERS +++$+++ They're coming.
L656541 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well?
L657837 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ Let's go.
L657836 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Thank you, friend.
L657835 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
L657834 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
L657782 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Just get me some horses.
L657781 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ You're chasing a dream.
L657779 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Then come with us.
L657778 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
L657769 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ They're not after me.  They want the baby.
L657768 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
L657763 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Is this what's left of your army?
L657762 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ You managed alright.
L657761 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ You left me to die, friend.
L657369 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
L657368 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
L657367 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
L657365 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
L657364 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
L657363 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
L657362 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
L657361 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ He thought you were a woman, Airk!
L657360 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
L657457 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
L657456 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ They look like acorns.
L657454 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
L657453 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
L657452 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
L657451 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ You are very important, Willow.
L657450 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
L657449 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
L657446 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ What is Tir Asleen?
L657445 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
L657444 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Me?
L657443 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
L657441 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
L657440 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
L657434 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
L657433 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Yes...?
L657432 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ Willow Ufgood.
L657291 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
L657290 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
L657289 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ Go in the direction the bird is flying.
L657288 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
L657287 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
L657286 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
L657285 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
L657284 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
L657256 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
L657255 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
L657238 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ It's a matter of great importance to me!
L657237 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ Not today, Willow.
L657236 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Sir!  I have to talk to you.
L657890 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ I have no family.
L657889 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
L657824 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ Madmartigan.
L657823 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Sorsha.
L657743 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L657742 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Because it's true.
L657741 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ I love you.
L657740 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Say what?
L657739 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ Why did you say that?
L657736 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ I'm not going to let this baby die.
L657735 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ You're a fool.  Now put her back.
L657704 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Too bad you're not more like your father.
L657703 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ I do what I'm told.
L657633 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ My step-father's going to tear you apart.
L657632 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
L657513 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ You're not a woman.
L657512 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Gawd...you're...beautiful...
L657508 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Why not?
L657507 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ Why not?
L657506 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ I can't.
L657504 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ Let me see it.
L657503 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ I can't.
L657501 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ No.  I mean yes.
L657500 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ You!  Are you the mother of that child?
L657877 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
L657876 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
L657651 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ As above, so below.
L657650 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ We're a tiny version of all that?
L657636 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
L657635 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Who is that girl, anyway?
L657621 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ I will!  But I need help!
L657620 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Then you get us out of here.
L657616 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ He turned that monster into stone!
L657615 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ He's no magician.
L657614 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
L657887 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
L657886 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ I don't know, Willow.
L657882 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
L657881 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
L657880 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
L657796 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Ahhh!
L657795 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Watch it!
L657794 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
L657793 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ She's a bird, Willow.
L657792 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
L657791 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
L657789 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
L657788 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Want me to carry Elora?
L657787 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
L657696 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
L657695 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ You?
L657685 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
L657684 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ She's in love.
L657682 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Well what did she say?
L657681 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ She asked about you, Madmartigan.
L657680 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Willow!
L657679 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ She said lots of thing.s
L657678 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
L657677 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Who?
L657676 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Did she ask about me?
L657649 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
L657648 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
L657623 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ I won't.
L657622 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I'll help you...!
L657550 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
L657549 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ You?
L657548 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
L657542 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
L657541 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Madmartigan, I need your help.
L657539 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
L657538 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
L657537 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
L657531 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ I did?
L657530 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
L657529 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
L657528 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Elora Danan!
L657527 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
L657525 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ I thought you had her!
L657524 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Where's the baby??
L657510 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Because she's sick.
L657509 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Because she's sick.
L657499 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Time to leave.
L657498 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Time to change her diaper.
L657495 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Nursemaid?!
L657494 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
L657493 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Hey!  Give me that baby!
L657486 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Where the hell did you come from?
L657485 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ You!!
L657388 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
L657387 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
L657385 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Of course!  I promise!
L657384 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
L657383 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Absolutely!
L657382 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Fresh goat's milk.
L657381 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ I will.
L657380 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ You gotta promise to feed her.
L657377 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ You don't know anything about ba- bies.
L657376 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
L657375 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I hate this.
L657374 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
L657372 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Friend of yours?
L657371 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
L657354 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ What is it?
L657353 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ You hear trouble.
L657352 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ What's that?  I hear something!
L657351 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
L657350 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Are you a warrior?
L657349 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Smells like a battle.
L657343 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
L657342 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ You all right?
L657335 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
L657334 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Farmer.
L657333 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ You a woodcutter?
L657329 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I don't know.
L657328 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
L657327 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Are you okay?
L657326 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Thanks for your help, Peck.
L657320 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
L657319 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Hey!  Somebody's coming!
L657316 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I have to give this baby to some- body.
L657315 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Why.
L657314 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
L657312 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Miserable Pecks.
L657311 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
L657310 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Don't make me angry, Peck.
L657309 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Good.  How long will it take?
L657308 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
L657283 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
L657282 +++$+++ u8932 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RANON +++$+++ I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
L657281 +++$+++ u8932 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RANON +++$+++ Are you scared?
L657280 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
L657279 +++$+++ u8932 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RANON +++$+++ Dada, what's a daikini?
L657207 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L657206 +++$+++ u8932 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RANON +++$+++ Can't we keep it, Dada?
L657203 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
L657202 +++$+++ u8932 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RANON +++$+++ It's not a Nelwyn baby.
L657900 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Courage, Willow.
L657899 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Patience, Willow.
L657896 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Surrender!!
L657895 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Time is running out.
L657865 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ She's too powerful, Raziel
L657864 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
L657863 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
L657853 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Just do it!
L657852 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Why?
L657851 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
L657816 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
L657815 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
L657812 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ More!  More!
L657811 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
L657809 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
L657808 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ How??
L657805 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ There's nobody here.
L657804 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Tir Asleen.
L657722 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
L657721 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I just wanted to test it first.
L657720 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Now use it.
L657719 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ His will.
L657718 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
L657716 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
L657715 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ What'd you bit me for!!
L657714 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Shhhhh!
L657713 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Ouch!!
L657712 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
L657711 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Oooh, this smells terrible.
L657694 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Me!
L657693 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ But what am I gonna transform??
L657692 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ The art of transformation!
L657691 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
L657690 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
L657689 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ The limitless power of...
L657688 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ What's the magician's weapon?
L657687 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
L657686 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
L657655 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
L657654 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ How am I gonna do that?
L657653 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Burn it to a fine ash.
L657652 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I'm all finished.  Now what?
L657647 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
L657646 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
L657645 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
L657644 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
L657640 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
L657639 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ What do I need for that?
L657638 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
L657626 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Then I will teach you.
L657625 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ That's all I ever wanted!
L657624 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ You must learn magic.
L657619 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
L657618 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ No.
L657617 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Did *you* give that acorn its power?
L657597 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Kill him!
L657596 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ No!
L657595 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Kill him!
L657586 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
L657585 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ What do you want!
L657581 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
L657580 +++$+++ u8933 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ RAZIEL +++$+++ Who are you!  Who are you!
L657612 +++$+++ u8934 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ ROOL +++$+++ Ouch!  Let go of me!
L657611 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Get back here, Rool!
L657610 +++$+++ u8934 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ ROOL +++$+++ Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
L657609 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ We gotta follow them.
L657556 +++$+++ u8934 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ ROOL +++$+++ Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
L657555 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Are you sure?
L657474 +++$+++ u8934 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ ROOL +++$+++ Me neither!
L657473 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ I'm not going in there.
L657417 +++$+++ u8934 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ ROOL +++$+++ He never misses.
L657416 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
L657411 +++$+++ u8934 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ ROOL +++$+++ Somebody has to do it.
L657410 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
L657670 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Here.  Hold her.
L657669 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
L657668 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ She's hungry.
L657665 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I don't know much about him.
L657664 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ Who is he?
L657663 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Madmartigan.
L657662 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ Who is that horrible friend of yours?
L657661 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
L657660 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ I changed her already!
L657659 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ She needs to be changed.
L657631 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ Shut up.
L657630 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
L657584 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
L657583 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
L657576 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
L657575 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Obviously.
L657568 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ The sorceress.
L657567 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
L657560 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ How are we going to get out there?
L657559 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
L657468 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
L657467 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Hey, careful there!
L657436 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I can't see anything--she's too bright!
L657435 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Talk!  Say something!
L657429 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
L657428 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ This is not going well.
L657424 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Why not?
L657423 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
L657422 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Ohhh, I hate this.
L657415 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
L657414 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I'm getting her out of there!
L657408 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ You're the guardian, aren't you?
L657407 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Who??
L657406 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
L657405 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Queen Cherlindrea?
L657404 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
L659186 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
L659185 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Guess I'm not used to so much.
L659184 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
L659160 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Not one this big.
L659159 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
L659156 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Good, you start tomorrow.
L659155 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ I've seen pictures.
L659154 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Cows. You know, cows?
L659153 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Milking?
L659152 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Maybe milking.
L659151 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
L658988 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Just do it!
L658987 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ John, why?...
L658986 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
L658985 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ John, I don't understand any of this.
L658984 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Put my car in the garage and close the door.
L658882 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ They're Amish.
L658881 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Who are these orphans, anyway?
L658880 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Oh sure, Fred.
L658879 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
L658878 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
L658877 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
L658876 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Where's Timmy and Buck?
L658875 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Sorry. It's important.
L658874 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
L659279 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Pick up the hat.

L659075 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him ֊L659074 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
L659073 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
L659072 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know ֠anybody who knows John ֠knows that's a goddamn lie!
L659071 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.

L659068 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Did you find him?
L658917 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
L658916 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
L658915 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No? Why not?
L658914 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
L658913 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ God, Fred...
L658912 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.

L658900 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
L658899 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
L658898 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
L658897 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
L658896 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!

L659210 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I will be the judge of that.
L659209 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ You are acting like one!
L659208 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I am not a child.

I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
L659206 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That is idle talk.
L659205 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
L659204 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I have committed no sin.
L659203 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
L659202 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I have done nothing against the ordnung.
L659201 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
L659188 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
L659187 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
L659026 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
L659025 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
L659024 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
L659023 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws ֊L659015 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I know.

L659465 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
L659464 +++$+++ u8962 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ UNCLE HENRY +++$+++ Uhh -- yeah --
L659390 +++$+++ u8962 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ UNCLE HENRY +++$+++ Yes.
L659389 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Oh, I hope we got them in time.
L659388 +++$+++ u8962 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ UNCLE HENRY +++$+++ Yes.
L659387 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
L659386 +++$+++ u8962 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ UNCLE HENRY +++$+++ Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
L659431 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
L659430 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
L659429 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
L659428 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
L659427 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
L659426 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --

L660354 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ You are?
L660353 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
L660352 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Who are you?
L660351 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ ... -- Oz -- has spoken!
L660342 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ Do you presume to criticize the....
L660341 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
L660334 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ Not so fast!  Not....
L660333 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
L660332 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ ...resourceful!
L660330 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh ....
L660329 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
L660328 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ ...have you come back?
L660087 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
L660086 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
L660085 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
L660084 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Our echo.
L660440 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Goodbye, folks!
L660439 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L660438 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
L660437 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
L660427 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
L660426 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Ohhh!
L660425 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
L660361 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh ....
L660360 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
L660357 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
L660356 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I don't believe you!
L660355 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Uhhhh -- yes...
L659423 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
L659422 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Are you all right, Dorothy?
L659421 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
L659415 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
L659414 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Hickory!
L659413 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Who did it? Now wait a minute.
L659412 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh!
L659411 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
L659410 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ This?
L659409 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
L659408 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
L659407 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
L660212 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ Catch him, you fool!
L660211 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Run, Toto, run!
L660208 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
L660207 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
L660206 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ Ahh!  Ah!
L660205 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
L660204 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
L660203 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
L660202 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
L660201 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
L660200 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, please give me back my dog!
L660199 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
L660198 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
L659620 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
L659619 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ ...didn't you?
L660472 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
L660471 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
L660470 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
L660469 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes, I'm ready now.
L660468 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
L660467 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Are you ready now?
L660462 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
L660461 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Whenever you wish.
L660460 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, now?
L660459 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Toto, too.
L660458 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...Toto, too?
L660448 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I have?
L660447 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
L660446 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
L659644 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
L659643 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ But, how do I start for Emerald City?
L659642 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
L659641 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No, I'm afraid I didn't.
L659640 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
L659639 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
L659638 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
L659637 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
L659636 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
L659615 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
L659614 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I thought you said she was dead.
L659565 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
L659564 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
L659563 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
L659557 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
L659556 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Toto's my dog.
L659554 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Oh!  Well....
L659553 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
L659552 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
L660489 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ But you couldn't have been, could you?
L660488 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Oh -- 
L659533 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
L659532 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
L659531 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
L659530 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, you....
L659529 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
L659528 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, no -- no!
L659527 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ ...bed.
L659526 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
L659525 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...paper?
L659524 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Has it poppies on the wall....
L659523 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ ...room --
L659521 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ What's she doing now?
L659520 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L659519 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
L659517 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Me?
L659516 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
L659515 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659514 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
L659513 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ That's right.  What's she doing?
L659512 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Her -- her name is Emily.
L659511 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes...That's Aunt Em.
L659510 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ ...her face is careworn.
L659507 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Oh -- yes.
L659506 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ That's our farm!
L659499 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
L659498 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
L659497 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Oh --
L659496 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No, they won't - honestly.
L659495 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Aw, come, come, come --
L659494 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
L659493 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Oh --
L659492 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
L659491 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
L659488 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
L659487 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Yes --
L659486 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
L659485 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
L659484 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why --
L659483 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
L659482 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ How did you guess?
L659481 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
L659473 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Stop her!
L659472 +++$+++ u8956 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MISS GULCH +++$+++ Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
L659469 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
L659468 +++$+++ u8956 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MISS GULCH +++$+++ Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
L659467 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No --
L659466 +++$+++ u8956 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MISS GULCH +++$+++ Now you're seeing reason.
L659458 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
L659457 +++$+++ u8956 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MISS GULCH +++$+++ That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
L660464 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
L660463 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
L660405 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Look -- it ticks!

L660070 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
L660069 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh, he's just ascared again.
L659992 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659991 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Can't that female take no for an answer?
L659881 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I'm sure he could give you some courage.
L659880 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ And him a brain.
L659853 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
L659852 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ What sort of an animal is that?
L659851 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ And bears!
L659835 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659834 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ We might.
L659825 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
L659824 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
L659811 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh-oh-
L659810 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
L659809 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659808 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh! Oh!
L659807 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh - I'll get it!
L659806 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
L659805 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
L659804 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
L659803 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh! They're - they're gone now.
L659793 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
L659792 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
L659791 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
L659788 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
L659787 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
L659786 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
L659785 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
L659778 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ All hollow.  Oh --

L659772 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --!
L659771 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
L659770 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Well, you're perfect now.
L659769 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ ...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
L659768 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
L659767 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
L659766 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
L659765 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...Oh, did that hurt?
L659764 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh --
L659763 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh...

L659756 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ My mouth -- my mouth!
L659755 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Where do you want to be oiled first?
L659752 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oil can....
L659751 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Did you say something?

L660466 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I think I'll miss you most of all.
L660465 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
L660444 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
L660443 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
L660442 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, now I'll never get home!
L660409 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.

L660277 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
L660276 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Did they hurtcha?
L660275 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
L660166 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
L660165 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
L660164 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
L660160 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
L660159 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
L660138 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L660137 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
L660136 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Does it work?
L660121 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Huh?  What'd he say?
L660120 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- Oh, come on.
L660077 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Ohh!
L660076 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, come on.
L660075 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Because I'm still scared!
L660074 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ But why?  Why?
L660073 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I'd sooner wait outside.
L660072 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
L660071 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
L660043 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
L660042 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Supposin' you met an elephant?
L660041 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
L660040 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ How about a hippopotamus?
L660037 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Not nobody, not nohow!
L660036 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
L660023 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
L660022 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I'll be home in time for supper!
L660010 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
L660009 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
L659990 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
L659989 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Who's her?  Who's her?
L659986 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Hah!

L659901 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
L659900 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
L659894 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ The nerve.
L659893 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ A home --
L659887 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
L659886 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh.
L659885 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ ...has been simply unbearable.
L659873 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ You're right -- I am a coward.
L659872 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
L659871 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
L659870 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
L659869 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No, but you tried to.
L659868 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
L659425 +++$+++ u8953 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HUNK +++$+++ What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
L659424 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
L659406 +++$+++ u8953 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HUNK +++$+++ Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
L659405 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
L659404 +++$+++ u8953 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HUNK +++$+++ Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
L659403 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I have so got brains.
L659402 +++$+++ u8953 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HUNK +++$+++ Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
L660304 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
L660303 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
L660302 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ No -- No -- No -- No!
L660158 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Did you just hear what I just heard?
L660157 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
L660149 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
L660148 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- Oh --
L660058 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
L660057 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
L660056 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659999 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
L659998 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Dear, whatever shall we do?
L659943 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
L659942 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ -- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
L659941 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
L659940 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Yes -- there --
L659937 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659936 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
L659914 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
L659913 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ ...along.
L659879 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
L659878 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
L659833 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
L659832 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
L659831 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
L659823 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
L659822 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
L659819 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
L659818 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
L659790 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
L659789 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
L659760 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes --- there.
L659759 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ The other side....
L659758 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Here -- here --

L659753 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oil can what?
L659749 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes.  Oh -- look --
L659748 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ What?
L659747 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
L659746 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659745 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
L659735 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
L659734 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
L659726 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ To Oz!
L659725 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ To Oz?
L659724 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
L659723 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
L659722 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
L659720 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
L659719 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I don't blame you for that.
L659718 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
L659717 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
L659716 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Yes -- that's true.
L659715 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
L659714 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
L659713 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Um-hmm.
L659712 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ You're going to see a Wizard?
L659711 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
L659710 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Where's Kansas?
L659709 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Um-hmm.
L659708 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ They would?
L659707 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
L659695 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
L659694 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Did I scare you?
L659693 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
L659692 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ ...free!
L659691 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ My, it's good to be....
L659690 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Ohhh --
L659689 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
L659688 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- does it hurt you?
L659687 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
L659686 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Ohh!
L659685 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Ohhhh --
L659684 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...yes.
L659680 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
L659679 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
L659678 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
L659661 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ It's pleasant down that way, too.
L659660 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...don't talk.
L659632 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
L659631 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
L659630 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
L659626 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ It's too late!  There they....
L659625 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
L659623 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
L659622 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ ...ting the ruby slippers?
L659618 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
L659617 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Leave her alone!
L659616 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
L660422 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ It did?
L660421 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ ...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
L660415 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
L660414 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Dorothy next!

L660412 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Yeah.
L660384 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
L660383 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Real courage. That's what we want.
L660359 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Yeah!
L660358 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ You humbug!

L660298 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Where -- where do we go now?
L660272 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
L660271 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Stop pushing!
L660260 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
L660259 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Come on -- I've got another idea.
L660248 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Now...
L660247 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Up!
L660240 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
L660239 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ That's right.
L660238 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
L660237 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Yes, you.
L660236 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Yeah. Me?
L660235 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ And you're going to lead us.
L660234 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Fine.  He's got a plan
L660233 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ I've got a plan how to get in there.
L660189 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
L660188 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
L660083 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ What was that?
L660082 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Here --   Come on.
L660081 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I -- Oh --
L660080 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, you did it yourself!
L660079 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Somebody pulled my tail.
L660078 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ What happened?
L660068 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ What's the matter?
L660067 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
L660062 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I don't know.
L660061 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Who at?
L660060 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Would...would it do any good if I roared?
L660045 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
L660044 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ What if it were a brontosaurus?
L659925 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Don't you start it, too!
L659924 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
L660379 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Not nohow!
L660378 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ You don't get around us that easy!
L660270 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Don't push!

L660246 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ You don't neither --
L660245 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ No?  Now, wait a minute.
L660227 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ I hope your tail holds out. Oh --

L660192 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
L660191 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
L660190 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
L660172 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Whozat?

L660169 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ It's a whatzis.

L660153 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
L660135 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ She - she can have my Witch Remover.
L660134 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
L660039 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Imposserous!
L660038 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Not even a rhinoceros?
L659920 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
L659919 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Dorothy!
L659877 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
L659876 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Why don't you try counting sheep?
L659875 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I haven't slept in weeks.
L659860 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Oh, scared, huh?

L660243 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ No, you don't.
L660231 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
L660230 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out.

L659908 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
L659907 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
L659906 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Hurry -- hurry --
L659905 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Come on -- come on --
L659892 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ A heart --
L659891 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Then I'm sure to get a brain --
L659889 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ I'd be clever as a gizzard --
L659888 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ I'd be gentle as a lizard --
L659837 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
L659836 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Animals that -- that eat straw?
L659829 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ To Oz!
L659828 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ To Oz?
L659827 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ We do.
L659826 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ That's right.
L659821 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ No, sir!
L659820 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ No, sir!
L659802 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
L659801 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
L659774 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
L659773 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Beautiful!  What an echo!
L660392 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
L660391 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ How can I ever thank you enough?
L660388 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Th.D.?
L660387 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
L660381 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ You promised us real things -- a real...
L660380 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well --
L660373 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well, I --
L660372 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ -- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
L660371 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well, I --
L660370 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
L660369 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well, I --
L660368 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ What about us?
L660367 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Yes.
L660366 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ It makes you nervous?
L660365 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
L660436 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Help!
L660435 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ -- Ruined my exit!
L660434 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
L660433 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
L660432 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Stop that dog!
L660398 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Yes -- ....
L660397 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ But I still want one.
L660396 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
L663196 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ So isnӴ it time you unwrapped your present?
L663195 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I love Christmas in Turkey.
L663192 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ We canӴ.
L663191 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ WeӶe got to get out.
L663180 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Count to twenty.  IӬl be there.
L663179 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ But what if...
L663178 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or weӬl sink.
L663171 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Just wanted to put him on edge...
L663170 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What kind of bikes did you ride?
L663169 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Like riding a bike.
L663168 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Do you know what youӲe doing?
L663167 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Heӳ going to insert the plutonium.
L663166 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Heӳ sealed himself in.
L663156 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ We go down to the torpedo bay.
L663155 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Is there another way?
L663103 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ If I donӴ get to the Boa before he gets to Maidenӳ Tower, M is dead.
L663102 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Zukovsky...
L663073 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Elektra would control it all.
L663072 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ The King pipeline.
L663071 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
L663070 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
L663067 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Made to look just like an accident.
L663066 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Heӳ not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subӳ reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
L663065 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Nuclear.
L662988 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Mӳ life is part of the bet.
L662987 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What is it?
L662979 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I was hoping you could tell me.
L662978 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
L662977 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Makes her look even more innocent.
L662976 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
L662975 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Elektra King.
L662974 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Whoӳ she?
L662973 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Itӳ part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
L662972 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L662971 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I did kill us. She thinks weӲe dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
L662970 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
L662953 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Itӳ a bomb alright. WeӲe still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
L662952 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Then itӳ no longer a bomb?
L662951 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ The plutonium is missing.  TheyӶe taken the core!
L662945 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Alright then, brunch.
L662944 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
L662943 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
L662880 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ With this?
L662879 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ They wonӴ get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
L662877 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Bond --
L662876 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ So who are you?
L662875 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Shame you had to spot I wasnӴ the real thing.
L662865 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Hereӳ your imposter. Heӳ paid off the men on the plane outside.  TheyӲe not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyӲe flying it wherever he tells them.
L662864 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ He is an impostor.  Thereӳ no Davidov at Miratom.
L662836 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werenӴ around, theyӤ have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
L662835 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ CouldnӴ make it. Splitting headache.
L662834 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What happened to Len Tashka?
L662833 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ DonӴ know any doctor jokes.
L662832 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, IӶe heard them all.
L662831 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
L662830 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ You new?
L662605 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I could come for a second opinion?
L662604 +++$+++ u8967 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ DOCTOR GREATREX +++$+++ ...yes?...
L662603 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Perhaps after this ... test?
L662602 +++$+++ u8967 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ DOCTOR GREATREX +++$+++ Then maybe IӤ be... open to that.
L662598 +++$+++ u8967 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ DOCTOR GREATREX +++$+++ James.  It wouldnӴ really be...
L662597 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Itӳ just a scratch.
L662596 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
L662595 +++$+++ u8967 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ DOCTOR GREATREX +++$+++ Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wonӴ just be two weeks out of action.
L662921 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Is maybe...the inside woman.
L662920 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ The inside man?
L662919 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ TheyӲe getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I canӴ help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
L662918 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
L662917 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The report King bought. Itӳ a manual. Renardӳ men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
L662651 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The worm on the hook again.
L662650 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnӴ completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
L662647 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Heӳ not through yet. Renard doesnӴ blow up five million dollars unless he knows thereӳ more coming in. Heӳ working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
L662646 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
L662645 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Ҕhat which does not kill me makes me stronger.ҊL662644 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
L662643 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ The doctor who saved him couldnӴ get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, heӳ a dead man.
L662642 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ He survived?
L662640 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, IӤ do the same again.
L662639 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
L662638 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektraӳ ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
L662637 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Renard.
L662636 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
L662635 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who?
L662634 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Itӳ a message.  He wants us to know heӳ back.
L662632 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
L662631 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Iӭ well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
L662630 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I was the one who brought that money in...
L662629 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ You havenӴ been given an assignment in this case.
L662628 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I took the initiative.
L662627 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Who told you to look at Elektraӳ files?
L662613 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ And now itӳ up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
L662612 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
L662611 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ 007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
L662593 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
L662592 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Itӳ barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
L662591 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ IӶe scheduled a medical for you.
L662590 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Sheӳ not a girl anymore.
L662589 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Elektra?  Running King Industries?  IӶe known that girl all her life. Iӭ not sure she knows what sheӳ walking into.
L662566 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
L662565 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Heӳ a man of great integrity.
L662564 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Old friend?
L662563 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Quite the opposite, in fact.
L662562 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Constructionӳ not exactly my line.
L662549 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ I canӴ tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
L662548 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The name?
L662546 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
L662545 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Your last chance. Give me the name.
L662544 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ Your last chance. Take the money.
L662543 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
L662542 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
L662541 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who did you get it from?
L662540 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
L662532 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Which is neutral, no doubt.
L662531 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
L663163 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ HavenӴ you heard the news?  So is she.
L663162 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ In case youӶe forgotten.  Iӭ dead already.
L662859 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnӴ have done it without you.
L662858 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ SheӬl get over it.
L662857 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Itӳ I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
L662856 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Consider me ungrateful.
L662855 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
L662854 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
L662853 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Sheӳ beautiful isnӴ she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
L662852 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who is it?
L662851 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
L662850 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Revenge isnӴ so hard to fathom. Whatӳ clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
L662844 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Indeed.
L662843 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
L662586 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
L662585 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Iӭ sorry.
L662584 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ He was my father.
L662583 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You knew him well?
L662582 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ A word? Iӭ sure by now heӳ engineered a hostile takeover.
L662581 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
L662580 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
L662579 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Yes.
L662578 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Beautiful, isnӴ it?
L663134 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Oh James.
L663133 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ One... last... screw?
L663130 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Elektra, itӳ not too late.  Eight million people neednӴ die.
L663129 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Know what happens when a man is strangled?
L663126 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
L663125 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Iӭ going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfatherӳ name, the glory of my people.
L663124 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ It is my oil!  Mine and my familyӳ!
L663123 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Was this all about the oil?
L663122 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
L663121 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ So you killed your father.
L663119 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Just like you...only you were even easier.
L663118 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You turned Renard.
L663117 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Since I was a child, IӶe always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnӴ rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
L663116 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Five more turns and your neck will break.
L663115 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ All this, because you fell for Renard?
L663114 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Soon sheӬl be everywhere.
L663113 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Whereӳ M?
L663111 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Not interested.
L663110 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I could have given you the world.
L662912 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You do what you have to do, but IӶe called in M.  Sheӳ en route from London even now.
L662911 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Iӭ coming with you.
L662909 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
L662908 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ He used your exact words.
L662907 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnӴ have to sleep with you to find that out.
L662905 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I think you do.
L662904 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I donӴ know what youӲe talking about!
L662903 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You can drop the act, itӳ over.
L662902 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Are you saying...Renard is the man whoӳ trying to kill me?
L662901 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
L662900 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ ...what?
L662899 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
L662898 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L662897 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ A little. Does it matter? After all, whatӳ the point of living if you canӴ feel alive?  IsnӴ that right, Elektra? IsnӴ that your motto?
L662896 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Whatӳ wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
L662816 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  IӶe never told anyone that.
L662815 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How did you survive?
L662809 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Shush.
L662808 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
L662799 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Not at that price. Time to surrender.
L662798 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Surely you believe in living dangerously.
L662783 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Really?
L662782 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I understand itӳ normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
L662777 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You had your chance, James. Now Iӭ looking for a bigger thrill.
L662776 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ If this little show is for my benefit, IӬl take you home right now.
L662775 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Someone wants to kill me, IӤ rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
L662774 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ What the hell are you doing here?
L662773 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Two. Shaken not stirred.
L662772 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Vodka martini.
L662744 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I have to go to work.
L662743 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I donӴ want to be safe!
L662742 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ No. YouӬl be safe here.
L662741 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Then take me with you.
L662740 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I have to go.
L662739 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ James...
L662738 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ ...you should rest.
L662737 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ What is it?
L662736 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I think youӲe one of the bravest people IӶe ever met.
L662735 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Iӭ a coward.
L662729 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I know.
L662728 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I canӴ stay.
L662723 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Itӳ the only way out...
L662722 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ No!  It will cave in!
L662721 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ YouӲe not going to.
L662720 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I canӴ stay here.
L662719 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ WeӲe alright.
L662718 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Oh my God...weӲe buried alive...
L662708 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ No.
L662707 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You donӴ take no for an answer, do you?
L662706 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Always wanted to see the upper lines.
L662705 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
L662698 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
L662697 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kingӳ daughter.
L662696 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Thatӳ every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thatӳ why youӲe here, isnӴ it? You think I canӴ do it. You think Iӭ going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
L662695 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The killer doesnӴ want to see this pipeline continue, doesnӴ want to see you take over...
L662694 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ If youӶe come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I donӴ need a third...
L662693 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Itӳ not the pin your father wore. Itӳ an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
L662692 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
L662691 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Itӳ my fatherӳ pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
L662690 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Does this look familiar to you?
L662689 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
L662688 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How long has he been with you?
L662687 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Heӳ decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
L662686 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who is he?
L662683 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Partially, yes.
L662682 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
L662681 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I donӴ want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Iӭ not sure he knew that.
L662680 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Funerals arenӴ exactly memorable.
L662679 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I havenӴ been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
L662678 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Yes.
L662677 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I met you at my fatherӳ funeral.
L663101 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ IӤ heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
L663100 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How appropriate.
L663099 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ The Maidenӳ Tower.
L663069 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
L663068 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Mother of God.
L663043 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Istanbul.
L663042 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Where?
L663041 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
L663036 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
L663035 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
L663034 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ No!  Get me out!
L663033 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Whereӳ the sub going?!
L663030 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
L663029 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ And the payoff on the tables?
L663028 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
L663024 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
L663023 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ A rope!
L663022 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Now...where were we?
L663018 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You are out of your league.  Sheӳ working with Renard.
L663017 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
L663016 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
L663015 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnӴ even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
L663014 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ I thought you were the one in her business.
L663013 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Whatӳ your business with Elektra King?
L663012 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Really Bond, couldnӴ you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
L663011 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
L663010 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Sheӳ no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
L663009 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
L662766 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
L662765 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
L662764 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How high up does this...arms dealing go?
L662763 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
L662761 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
L662760 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Where did you get this?
L662759 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
L662758 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ What?  This is not possible.
L662757 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
L662756 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ See?  YouӲe upsetting my customers. What do you want?
L662751 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Have some of the ratӳ nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
L662750 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little ratӳ nest.
L662749 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Bond, Iӭ a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familyӳ, now itӳ mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
L662748 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You, of course. I need some information.
L662747 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
L662746 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Valentin Zukovsky.
L663064 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ C-class.
L663063 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What class sub does your nephew run?
L663062 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
L663059 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
L663058 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What is this place?
L663038 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Bond!
L663037 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ No! Bond!
L663032 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
L663031 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What?
L663087 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
L663086 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Someone will come.
L663085 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyӲe coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
L663001 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
L663000 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Your father...
L662999 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnӴ think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
L662965 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Please.
L662964 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Perhaps this isnӴ the time...
L662890 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Could...could you come?
L662889 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ IӬl send someone out.
L663141 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Yes.  Au revoir...
L663140 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Everythingӳ under control up here.  Are you ready?
L663093 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
L663092 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ This is the end.
L663049 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ What do you think?
L663048 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ He was a...good lover?
L663047 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Of course...
L663046 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Itӳ what you wanted.
L663045 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ How would you know?
L663044 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
L662994 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Is it?
L662993 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Warm.
L663194 +++$+++ u8972 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Still no contact yet.
L663193 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Any word from him?
L662931 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Where it can do the most damage.
L662930 +++$+++ u8972 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Itӳ heading for the oil terminal.
L662929 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ The parcelӳ in the post.
L662883 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Marvellous.
L662882 +++$+++ u8972 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...

L662609 +++$+++ u8972 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
L662608 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ WeӶe been pawns in someoneӳ game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
L663447 +++$+++ u8975 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ADAMSON +++$+++ Please.
L663446 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What?!
L663445 +++$+++ u8975 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ADAMSON +++$+++ The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
L663444 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I would like to use the bathroom --
L663443 +++$+++ u8975 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ADAMSON +++$+++ I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
L663442 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Why?  What's the problem?
L663441 +++$+++ u8975 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ADAMSON +++$+++ Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
L663440 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
L663643 +++$+++ u8987 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
L663642 +++$+++ u8976 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ANALYST +++$+++ We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
L663641 +++$+++ u8987 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
L663640 +++$+++ u8976 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ANALYST +++$+++ As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
L663638 +++$+++ u8976 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ANALYST +++$+++ Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
L663637 +++$+++ u8987 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What kind of time frame are we talking about?
L663636 +++$+++ u8976 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ANALYST +++$+++ Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
L663635 +++$+++ u8987 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What about our end?
L663303 +++$+++ u8977 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
L663302 +++$+++ u8981 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ HYDE +++$+++ Washington?
L663301 +++$+++ u8977 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
L663300 +++$+++ u8981 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ HYDE +++$+++ Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
L663299 +++$+++ u8977 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ No idea who's behind this?
L663298 +++$+++ u8981 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ HYDE +++$+++ You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
L663297 +++$+++ u8977 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Had a lot of blood in him.
L663846 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
L663845 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
L663829 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ We don't know that.
L663828 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ God isn't there to do it.
L663827 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
L663826 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
L663825 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
L663824 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ Who is she?  Do you know her?
L663823 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ A whore fucking.
L663779 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
L663778 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
L663777 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Wrong answers?
L663776 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
L663775 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Don't call me that.
L663774 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ Walter --
L664176 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
L664175 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
L663366 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
L663365 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
L663363 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
L663362 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ What's your theory?
L663361 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
L663360 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
L663357 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
L663356 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ The bearer of bad news.
L663352 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Hello, Adrian.
L663351 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Hi, Jon.
L664185 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
L664184 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon -- for Godڳ sake, what do you see?
L664183 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
L664182 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon --
L664169 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Veidtڳ complex.
L664168 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon, where are we?
L664155 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ The south pole.  Timeڳ flowing backwards.
L664154 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon -- what??
L664153 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Itڳ very strange.  Timeڳ flowing backwards . . .
L664141 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Cured, yes.
L664140 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What -- am I --
L664139 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
L664138 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
L664137 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
L664136 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I won't do that.
L664135 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
L664134 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ You're the only human being I care for.
L664133 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
L664132 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
L664131 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon, I do not want to hear it.
L664082 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
L664081 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
L664080 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
L664079 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
L664078 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Because --
L664077 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
L664076 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Always.  Ever since the day I died.
L664075 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
L664074 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
L664073 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ But you knew that I'd -- die.
L664072 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
L664071 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
L664070 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
L664069 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
L664067 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
L664066 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
L664065 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
L664064 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
L664062 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You -- you know about me and Dan?
L664061 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
L664060 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
L664047 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
L664046 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
L664041 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
L664040 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon, no -- I can't --
L664039 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
L664038 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Collect me?
L664037 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
L663397 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ . . . And just how would you manage that?
L663396 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I could stay and go.
L663395 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Mm hmm.
L663394 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Would you like me to stay?
L663392 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Not yet, there's plenty of time.
L663391 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
L663390 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I'm here, Laurie.
L663359 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
L663358 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Blake?  Dead?
L664172 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
L664171 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
L664170 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
L664165 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Then Iڶe been a very bad boy and youڬl have to spank me.  Christ!  Iڭ doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
L664164 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What if youڲe wrong??
L664163 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Iڭ not.
L664162 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ And what if youڲe wrong?
L664161 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Donڴ be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wonڴ even be here, will we?
L664150 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
L664149 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian -- you've lost it.
L664148 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
L664147 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What is it?  How does it work?
L664146 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
L664128 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
L664127 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
L664126 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
L664117 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
L664116 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What??
L664111 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
L664110 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ The missing scientists.
L664109 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
L663803 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
L663802 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
L663801 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ She's with me.
L663800 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
L663799 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Who?
L663343 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Good night.
L663342 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
L663341 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No.  I just wanted you to --
L663340 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
L663339 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
L663338 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
L663337 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
L663336 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
L663335 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
L663334 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
L663333 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
L664215 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
L664214 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
L664213 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan -- what do we do now?
L664201 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Everything's changed --
L664200 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Those cars.  What year is this??
L664199 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan, is this -- is this New York??
L664196 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Where did he go?
L664195 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ He saved himself.  He changed the past.
L664179 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
L664178 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What was he doing?
L664018 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
L664017 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Welcome back, Night Owl.
L664001 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
L664000 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
L663985 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
L663984 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I think he's going to the john.
L663983 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What's he doing?
L663949 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ . . . What??
L663948 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
L663947 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
L663946 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
L663945 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ That's because --
L663944 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
L663943 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Yes you are.
L663942 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
L663941 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ The costumes.  Am I right?
L663940 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What?
L663923 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
L663922 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ They're practically on us . . .
L663921 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
L663920 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
L663915 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ All right.  Mission accomplished.
L663914 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ They're following us.
L663891 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
L663890 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
L663889 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What the hell -- ?
L663869 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Okay!
L663868 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ This'd better not be what I think it is.
L663867 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Don't look.  Turn around.
L663866 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What are you up to?
L663865 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
L663864 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
L663863 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
L663861 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ You and me.
L663860 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
L663859 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
L663858 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Antarctica??
L663857 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
L663854 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ -- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
L663853 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
L663849 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Memory lane.
L663848 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
L663810 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
L663809 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
L663808 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Laurie --
L663807 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
L663806 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ -- What is it.
L663805 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
L663804 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
L663758 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
L663757 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
L663754 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
L663753 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
L663725 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
L663724 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ . . . What?
L663723 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
L663722 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Old?
L663721 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
L663720 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
L663719 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
L663718 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
L663706 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Play one.  Educate yourself.
L663705 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
L663704 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
L663697 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
L663696 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ His . . . whatever.
L663695 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ His what?
L663663 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
L663662 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
L663658 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You're sure?
L663657 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
L663656 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
L663654 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
L663653 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Maybe not, but why take chances?
L663652 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
L663651 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
L663650 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
L663649 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
L663432 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
L663431 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
L663430 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
L663429 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
L663428 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
L663427 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
L663426 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Damn straight!  We were heroes.
L663425 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Damn straight.
L663421 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ 
L663420 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
L663419 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
L663418 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
L663417 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
L663416 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
L663415 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
L664160 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian.  Itڳ too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
L664159 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ . . . And they call me a fucking nut.
L664108 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
L664107 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
L664106 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
L664088 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
L664087 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ What caused it?
L664086 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
L664085 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ What happened?
L664057 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
L664056 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
L664055 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ SHUT UP, Rorschach.
L664054 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Coward.  Giving up.
L664053 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
L664052 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
L664051 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
L664044 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I don't think she's coming with us.
L664043 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Where's Laurie?
L664024 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
L664023 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
L664022 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
L664021 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
L664020 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What do you mean, frame-up?
L664019 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
L663999 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
L663998 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What new information?
L663997 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
L663996 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
L663987 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
L663986 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ . . . That was quick.
L663327 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
L663326 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
L663325 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
L663324 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ So do I.  So do you.
L663322 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
L663321 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
L663319 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
L663318 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
L663545 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
L663544 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ -- What?
L663543 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ I can fix it.
L663539 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ Janey, will you marry me?
L663538 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
L663536 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
L663535 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ Nothing.  What were you going to say?
L663534 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ We should get back --  What?
L663533 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
L663532 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
L663531 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ Nothing wrong with ketchup.
L663530 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ With lots of ketchup?
L663529 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
L663787 +++$+++ u8984 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Isn't it true that you --
L663786 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I did not.  Now get out of my way!
L663785 +++$+++ u8984 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Did you know he was back on the streets?
L663784 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ No comment.
L663682 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
L663681 +++$+++ u8984 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
L663680 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
L663679 +++$+++ u8984 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
L663678 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
L663599 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
L663598 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon??  You mean he's --
L663597 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
L663596 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
L663595 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
L663594 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Am I free to go?
L663593 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
L663468 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
L663467 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
L663466 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What does this mean?  What does it --
L663465 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry.
L663464 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
L663463 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
L663462 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Then why don't you ask him?!?
L663461 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
L663460 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I don't know their real names!
L663459 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
L663458 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I don't know their real names.
L663457 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ Their real names, please.
L663379 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I'm sorry about Blake.
L663378 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Maybe I'll do that.
L663377 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
L663376 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
L663375 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ What about you?
L663374 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
L663373 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
L663372 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
L663371 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ He's a little farther gone every time.
L663370 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Please.
L663369 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
L663368 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
L663350 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
L663349 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
L663348 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Don't rub it in.  I live here.
L663347 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Laurie!  Good to see you.
L663346 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Adrian.
L663671 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
L663670 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
L663629 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
L663628 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
L663627 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
L663626 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
L663622 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
L663621 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
L663620 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ You're making a big --
L663619 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
L663618 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
L664123 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
L664122 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
L664119 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
L664118 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
L664113 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
L664112 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
L663691 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
L663690 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
L663689 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
L663688 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ What is that ungodly smell?
L663687 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
L663686 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Ever see one of these before?
L663685 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ New information.
L665331 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're a jerk-off, you know that?
L665330 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
L665329 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
L665328 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
L665327 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
L665326 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
L665325 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Who says you're the good guys?
L665324 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
L665323 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
L665322 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
L665321 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
L665320 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
L665247 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
L665246 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
L665245 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
L665244 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
L665243 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
L665242 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
L665241 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
L665240 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Yes it does.
L665239 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
L665238 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
L665237 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
L665162 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You ain't seen nothing yet.
L665161 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
L665160 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Thanks.
L665159 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
L665158 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
L665157 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
L665156 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
L665155 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
L664955 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
L664954 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
L664953 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
L664952 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
L664951 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
L664950 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ We're not after car thieves here.
L664949 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
L664948 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
L664947 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
L664946 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
L664945 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
L664869 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Just remember, I'll be watching.
L664868 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Is that all?
L664867 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
L664866 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Up yours.
L664863 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
L664862 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
L664859 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Yeah, I spy or I die.
L664858 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
L664857 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
L664849 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
L664848 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Not bad for a gimp.
L664847 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.
L664846 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
L664845 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What do I get out of it?
L664844 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
L664843 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
L664839 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
L664838 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
L664837 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
L664836 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
L664835 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
L664834 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
L664833 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
L664832 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
L664831 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
L664830 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
L664772 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
L664771 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
L664770 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
L664769 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Is that a fact?
L664768 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
L664767 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
L664766 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
L664765 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
L664764 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Why is that?
L664763 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ ..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
L664762 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
L664761 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
L664760 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
L664759 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
L664758 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
L664757 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
L664756 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
L664753 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?
L664752 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Looks like a diner.
L664751 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What is this place?
L664750 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
L664749 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Who the hell are you?
L664964 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
L664963 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
L664962 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
L664961 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
L664960 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
L664959 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
L664958 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ You what? A wire transfer of this size?
L664957 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I think we should send him whatever he wants.
L664956 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
L664695 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ That's exactly why we need them.
L664694 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
L664693 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ I've seen enough. Turn it off.
L664692 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ But programmable. And expendable.
L664691 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ The scum of the Earth.
L664690 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
L664689 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
L664688 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
L664687 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
L664686 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ How will you fix it?
L664685 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
L664684 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
L664683 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
L664682 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
L664681 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
L664680 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ What do you have?
L664809 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
L664808 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
L664807 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
L664806 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
L664800 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
L664799 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
L664798 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
L664797 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
L664796 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ Whatchu doing here?
L664891 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ He gets to be the hero.
L664890 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Like what?
L664889 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
L664888 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
L664887 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ What do you get if you finish?
L664886 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
L664885 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ What weapons do you have?
L664884 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
L664883 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ "Anarchy" 99"?
L664882 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
L664879 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
L664878 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
L664877 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ Naturally.
L664876 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
L664874 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You wanna check it out? Come here.
L664873 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
L664872 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
L664871 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ What game is that?
L665336 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
L665335 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L665334 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
L665333 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
L665314 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
L665313 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
L665312 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
L665311 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
L665309 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
L665308 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
L665307 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You can't talk to it?
L665306 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ He's shut out the communication circuit!
L665303 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
L665302 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ A piece of shrapnel hit me.
L665301 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You okay?
L665298 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Let me.
L665297 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Toadies right behind.
L665296 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Go to the water, it's that way!
L665295 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Where'd the damn truck go?!
L665289 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
L665288 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Where's he headed?
L665287 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Let's do this.
L665286 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
L665285 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Did you do your homework?
L665282 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
L665281 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Yorgi and Kirill.
L665270 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
L665269 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
L665230 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
L665229 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
L665228 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
L665227 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
L665226 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
L665225 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You don't have to do that.
L665224 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
L665223 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
L665222 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Aren't you afraid?
L665221 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We'll have to go after them.
L665220 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
L665218 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
L665217 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We can't leave now. We have to do something.
L665216 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
L665215 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
L665214 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
L665213 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
L665212 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
L665211 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
L665210 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
L665209 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Where are we going?
L665208 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
L665207 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What are you doing with the Ivans?
L665206 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
L665205 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
L665204 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
L665203 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Are you alright?
L665179 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
L665178 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ When can I see you again?
L665177 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
L665176 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
L665175 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
L665174 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
L665173 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
L665172 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
L665171 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
L665170 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's that?
L665169 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
L665168 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
L665167 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
L665166 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
L665132 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
L665131 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
L665129 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
L665128 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ That's alright, I'll figure something out.
L665127 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
L665126 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
L665125 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
L665124 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
L665123 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L665122 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ They tell me you're an American agent.
L665116 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
L665115 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
L665114 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
L665113 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
L665112 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
L665111 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
L665110 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
L665109 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
L665108 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
L665107 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
L665106 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
L665105 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
L665104 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm from L.A.
L665103 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
L665098 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
L665097 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What are you?
L665095 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
L665094 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Go to hell!
L665093 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
L665092 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L665084 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
L665083 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
L665082 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hey, you're good.
L665081 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
L665080 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
L665079 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
L665078 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
L665077 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We hung out last night, remember?
L665076 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Who are you?
L665049 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That right? Why's that?
L665048 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
L665047 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
L665046 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
L665045 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I was invited. What's your story?
L665044 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
L665043 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Where are you going?
L665042 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
L665041 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Mind your business.
L665040 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
L665039 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Go to hell.
L665038 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You do everything Yorgi says?
L665037 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Yorgi asked me to.
L665036 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
L664938 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
L664937 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
L664936 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
L664935 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
L664934 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Do you know what a wire transfer is?
L664933 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
L664932 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
L665260 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Nice place to start, don't you think?
L665259 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ The Peace conference...
L665148 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Viktor! Stay the course.
L665147 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
L665146 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
L665145 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
L665144 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ What was that for?
L665139 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
L665138 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L664998 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
L664997 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Nothing. He had two days.
L664994 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I thought that was in detail.
L664993 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
L664992 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're joking, right?
L664991 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
L664990 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ From the Beastie Boys collection?
L664989 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
L664988 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I think I'll hang on to these.
L664984 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That one I'm real familiar with.
L664983 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ This is your standard dart gun.
L664982 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ They come in any other styles or colors?
L664981 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
L664975 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
L664974 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
L664973 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
L664972 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
L664971 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
L664967 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That's would be me.
L664966 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
L664722 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
L664721 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
L664720 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
L664719 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
L664718 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
L664717 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
L664716 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You're serious?
L664715 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
L664714 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ What...?
L664713 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
L664712 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
L664711 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Alright, so I'll get more.
L664710 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
L664708 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
L664707 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
L664706 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm having fun, what's the problem?
L664705 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
L664704 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I can see that. Why?
L664703 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ I'm through, Xander.
L664702 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
L665201 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
L665200 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Why you dogging me up?
L665199 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
L665198 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's the deal?
L665197 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ Sorry, "dude".
L665195 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ Is this what you're looking for?
L665194 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
L665193 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
L665192 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Dude, what are you doing here?
L664970 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Yeah, thanks a lot.
L664969 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ I'll leave you two alone to talk.
L664903 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ The corner. Anarchy 99.
L664902 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Nice hops.
L664900 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
L664899 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
L664898 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Here we go again.
L664897 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
L664896 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
L664895 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ Sit down.
L664824 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
L664823 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
L664818 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ It's like you said, every man for himself.
L664817 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Help me with this guy.
L664803 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ He's a pretty good actor, though.
L664802 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
L664780 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ A parachute. This does not argue well.
L664779 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
L664775 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Been to any good diners lately?
L664774 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ What's so damn funny?
L665272 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
L665271 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
L665268 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
L665267 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
L665266 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
L665265 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Including rape, pillage, murder.
L665264 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
L665263 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
L665262 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
L665261 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
L665258 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
L665257 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
L665256 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
L665250 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
L665249 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ That was for Anders.
L665067 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
L665066 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
L665065 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
L665059 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
L665058 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
L665057 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
L665056 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
L665055 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
L665054 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
L665053 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
L665033 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
L665032 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
L665031 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
L665030 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ "...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
L665029 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
L665028 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
L665027 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
L665026 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You wanna see my politics?
L665025 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
L665024 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's "Anarchy 99"?
L665023 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
L665020 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Had to do what I had to do.
L665019 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
L665014 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
L665013 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
L665012 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
L665011 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ What's going on, my friend?
L665004 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ This is a gift. From me to you.
L665003 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's this?
L665002 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Of course.
L665001 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I had to inspect the merchandise first.
L665000 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
L664999 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Very nice. I'm impressed.
L664940 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It'll work faster if I have an account number.
L664939 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
L664930 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
L664929 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
L664926 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ When else are you gonna do it?
L664925 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
L664919 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
L664918 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
L664917 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
L664916 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
L664915 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
L664914 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
L664910 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
L664909 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ This pizda? Never seen him before.
L664908 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That's the guy.
L664564 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ Beast.
L664563 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
L664562 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ We all do.
L664561 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ I wish I could go.
L664555 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ ... until he found tungsten.
L664554 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
L664509 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
L664508 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ What does that mean?
L664559 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
L664558 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
L664557 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ For what purpose?
L664556 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
L664553 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Its core?
L664552 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
L664511 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
L664510 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Can the Professor repair his own mind?
L664610 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
L664609 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Jean... can you?
L664595 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
L664594 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ It's too far.
L664593 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
L664575 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L664574 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Into the Hudson?
L664573 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
L664570 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
L664569 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ What's that?
L664568 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I'll tell you one thing though.
L664567 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
L664566 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
L664515 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
L664514 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Are you all right?
L664513 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ We have to find Magneto.
L664512 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
L664503 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
L664502 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
L664396 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
L664395 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
L664394 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L664393 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I don't like him being here.
L664392 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Scott.. I -
L664642 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Sure you are, sport.
L664641 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
L664427 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
L664426 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ You know, you --
L664425 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
L664423 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
L664422 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ How long have you been in Alaska?
L664419 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I wanted to talk to you.
L664418 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
L664482 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Yeah, I'll bet you have.
L664481 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I've seen a lot of rings.
L664480 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Logan, do you see this ring?
L664478 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
L664477 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ He takes himself seriously.
L664476 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ He takes his work seriously.
L664475 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ He's uptight.
L664474 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Suit yourself.
L664473 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Let go.
L664472 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Not interested.
L664471 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What do you say?
L664470 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Were you now?
L664469 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
L664468 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ He's busy right now.
L664467 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You should always work with a spotter.
L664390 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What if they're naughty?
L664389 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ If necessary.
L664388 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ By reading my thoughts?
L664387 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
L664386 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
L664385 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
L664384 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What if I like the pain?
L664383 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
L664382 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I won't light the cigars - how about that?
L664381 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
L664380 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Some cigars.  Case of beer.
L664379 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Anything else I can get you?
L664537 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
L664536 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
L664526 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
L664525 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
L664524 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
L664519 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Senator?
L664518 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Dr. Grey.
L664268 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
L664267 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
L664266 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
L664265 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
L664264 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
L664263 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
L664262 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
L664259 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
L664258 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
L664319 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Let's just say, God works too slowly.
L664318 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What is it you intend to do to me?
L664317 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
L664316 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ The intention of registration act -
L664312 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Gosh, I hope so.
L664311 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
L664310 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You mutant bastards...
L664309 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
L664308 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
L664580 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
L664579 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L664578 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ You're backstage at the encore of creation.
L664577 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Where am I?
L664497 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
L664496 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Come with me and I'll let her live.
L664495 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What do you want?
L664494 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ I do love a good check mate.
L664654 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
L664653 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
L664652 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
L664651 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
L664650 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Don't you knock?
L664450 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'll go.
L664449 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ I've found her, Westchester Mall.
L664447 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
L664446 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ He helped you?
L664445 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
L664444 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You designed this yourself?
L664443 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
L664442 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ How?
L664441 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ To find Rogue.
L664440 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Where are we going?
L664436 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
L664435 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
L664434 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Now that's Magneto talking.
L664433 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
L664432 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
L664431 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
L664430 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ The point of what?
L664371 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Deal.
L664370 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
L664303 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
L664302 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Who?
L664301 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
L664300 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What am I doing here?
L664416 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
L664415 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ If she held on any longer she could have.
L664414 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I felt like she almost killed me.
L664413 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
L664412 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What did she do to me?
L664411 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
L664410 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Why is everybody up at sunrise?
L664378 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ ALIVE.
L664377 +++$+++ u9008 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ SABRETOOTH +++$+++ I'll find him.
L664286 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Enough for a test.
L664285 +++$+++ u9008 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ SABRETOOTH +++$+++ Is it enough?
L664284 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ A piece.  Only a piece.
L664283 +++$+++ u9008 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ SABRETOOTH +++$+++ Is that what you're looking for?
L664278 +++$+++ u9008 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ SABRETOOTH +++$+++ It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
L664277 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ How?
L664276 +++$+++ u9008 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ SABRETOOTH +++$+++ I lost him.
L664665 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
L664664 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ And what do you do when you wake up to that?
L664663 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ It does indeed, Max.
L664662 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
L664661 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ I know.
L664660 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
L664365 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
L664364 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
L664363 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ What do you mean to do?
L664362 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
L664361 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ The way what is going to be?
L664360 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
L664355 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
L664354 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
L664353 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
L664352 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Is that so?
L664350 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ What do you want with him?
L664349 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
L664346 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Not at the cost of lives, Max.
L664345 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
L664344 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ And I'll never understand terrorists.
L664343 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
L665374 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
L665373 +++$+++ u9011 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ANASTASIA +++$+++ Oh, shit.
L665372 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
L665371 +++$+++ u9011 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ANASTASIA +++$+++ And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
L665370 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ Yes, my dear, he is.
L665369 +++$+++ u9011 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ANASTASIA +++$+++ Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
L666093 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ Now wait a minute!
L666092 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
L666088 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Poppycock!
L666087 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
L666086 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Ugly, vicious rumous.
L666085 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
L666084 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Victor Frankenstein.
L666083 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ What was your grandfather's name?
L666082 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No!
L666081 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
L666080 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
L666079 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ And who might you be?
L666078 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You have the wrong house.
L666077 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ Frederick Frankenstein?
L665456 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ ... No!
L665455 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
L665454 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
L665453 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ Yes, sir?
L665452 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Carlson!
L665435 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
L665434 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L665424 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L665423 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Give him an extra dollar.
L665406 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
L665405 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ No, sir.  It will never happen again.
L665404 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
L665403 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
L665402 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
L665401 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ From your office, sir.
L665400 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Where did you get this cauliflower?
L665379 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
L665378 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L665377 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
L665368 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ 'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
L665367 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
L665366 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
L665365 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
L665364 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
L665363 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ I did, sir.
L665362 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
L666203 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMmmm.
L666202 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
L666201 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMmmm.
L666200 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Love me oodles and oodles?
L666199 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMmmm.
L666198 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Still happy you married me?
L666197 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMmmm.
L666196 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
L666130 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
L666129 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMMMM!  MMMMM!
L666128 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Is it that music?
L666127 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMMmm!
L666125 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
L666124 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMMmmmm.
L666123 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
L666119 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ Baack!
L666118 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What?
L666117 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ Baack!
L666116 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What in God's name are you doing?
L665976 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I...
L665975 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Miss me?
L665974 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Well... yes.
L665973 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Surprised?
L665972 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Hello...?
L665971 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Darling!
L666017 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ That's my good boy.
L666016 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Good night.
L666015 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
L666014 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I suppose you're right.
L666013 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Is it worth taking a chance?
L666012 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ That's a tough choice.
L666011 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
L666010 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
L666009 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
L666008 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
L666007 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
L666005 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
L666004 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I suppose you're right.
L666003 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
L666002 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
L666001 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
L666000 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
L665999 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Darling, you mustn't worry so.
L665998 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
L665986 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ All right then!
L665985 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ No, of course not.  I just meant...
L665984 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Are you suggesting I call him master???
L665983 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Why does he call you 'master'?
L665982 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
L665981 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What a strange fellow.
L665979 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
L665978 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
L665977 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Ready, darling?
L665968 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
L665967 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Darling!?!
L665966 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
L665965 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Love me?
L665964 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Surprised!
L665963 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Surprised?
L665962 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Darling!
L665961 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Darling!
L665523 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Goodbye, darling!
L665522 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Goodbye, darling.
L665521 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Goodbye, darling.
L665520 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I will!  Goodbye, darling!
L665515 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You bet your boots it does.
L665514 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Does that mean you love me?
L665513 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You're incorrigible!
L665512 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
L665511 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Whatever makes you happy.
L665510 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I hope you like large weddings.
L665509 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Oh, nice.
L665508 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
L665507 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Very....very!
L665506 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Will you miss me?
L665503 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Oh, darling -- so will I.
L665502 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
L665501 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I promise.
L665500 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Promise??
L665499 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes.
L665498 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Call me from New York before you leave??
L665497 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, don't worry.
L665496 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ And your passport?
L665495 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes.
L665494 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You have your tickets?
L665493 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Of course.
L665492 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Darling!...you will be careful!?
L665956 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
L665955 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
L665954 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
L665614 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Good.
L665613 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
L665612 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
L665611 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ Will there be anything else?
L665610 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well... we'll see.
L665609 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ I think you must be mistaken, sir.
L665608 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
L665607 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ This is the only library I know of.
L665606 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
L665605 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ I don't know what you mean, sir.
L665604 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
L665603 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
L665602 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ There seem to be quite a few books.
L665600 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ May I have it, please?
L665599 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
L665598 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes!... the laboratory.
L665597 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ You mean... the laboratory??
L665596 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Does that include the key to the laboratory?
L665595 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
L665594 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It seems fine.
L665593 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
L665491 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
L665490 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
L665489 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
L665488 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
L665487 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
L665486 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ One week at the most!?
L665485 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L665484 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
L665482 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
L665481 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I didn't do that.
L665480 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Break that old man's violin.
L665479 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What?
L665478 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Why did you do that?
L665477 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
L665466 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
L665465 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ A week.  Ten days at most.
L665464 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ How long will this whole thing take?
L665463 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
L665462 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
L665461 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
L665459 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
L665458 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Fron kon steen!
L665457 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Dr. Frankenstein?
L665450 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
L665449 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ But your grandfather's work, sir...
L665448 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
L665447 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
L665446 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ But, sir...
L665445 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
L665444 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
L665443 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
L665442 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Nineteen, sir.
L665441 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ How old are you, young man?
L665440 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
L665439 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
L665438 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
L665437 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ My father was a sick man.
L665436 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
L665431 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
L665430 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Vermicelli.
L665429 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ A piece of what?
L665428 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
L665427 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes?
L665426 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Dr. Fronkonsteen!
L665425 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
L665394 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
L665393 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
L665392 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
L665391 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
L665390 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
L665389 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
L665388 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
L665387 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
L665386 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L665385 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
L666138 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
L666137 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It's the only way.
L666136 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
L666135 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Is everything ready?
L666134 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Come on, big fellow!
L666104 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I'll bet it's a doozy.
L666103 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ There's only one way.
L666102 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
L666101 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ ... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
L666100 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ That sound good, boss.
L666099 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
L666096 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ He's carrying her off now through the woods.
L666095 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What???
L666094 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
L666091 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
L666090 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What monster?
L665948 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
L665947 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm a failure.
L665907 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ That's what we're paid for.
L665906 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Thanks...for all your help.
L665884 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Maybe...if you get here on time.
L665883 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Can you play it?
L665882 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
L665881 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ How do you know it was a 'she'?
L665880 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ All right -- where is she?
L665879 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ How do you know it was a 'he'?
L665878 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Where is he?
L665877 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Someone was playing this in the music room.
L665876 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What did you find out?
L665875 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ How's it going?
L665855 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Act casual!
L665854 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Yes, Master!
L665853 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
L665852 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
L665835 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ ... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
L665834 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ No, no!  That whole thing!
L665833 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ ... I'm glad that's...
L665832 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
L665831 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm not trying to be funny.
L665830 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
L665829 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Why?
L665828 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
L665827 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes.
L665826 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You can say that again.
L665825 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
L665824 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Give -- me -- your -- hand!
L665823 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Original.
L665810 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
L665809 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
L665808 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Don't fall for that one.
L665807 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
L665806 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
L665805 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
L665797 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ It wasn't me.
L665796 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But you did -- I just heard it.
L665795 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
L665794 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
L665793 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Who are you talking to?
L665792 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
L665789 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
L665788 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
L665787 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
L665786 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You'll be getting me sad next.
L665785 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Well, I don't like to see you mope.
L665784 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Don't try to cheer me up that way.
L665783 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
L665782 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Cold!  Cold and dead!
L665779 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
L665778 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You can't win 'em all.
L665772 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Wait till he sees the bill.
L665771 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Throw the third switch!
L665770 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What?
L665769 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ More, do you hear me?
L665768 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What?
L665767 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
L665766 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ This guy means business.
L665765 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Throw the second switch!
L665761 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You've got it, master.
L665760 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
L665759 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Tonight?
L665758 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
L665754 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ All right... elevate me!
L665753 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
L665747 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
L665746 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
L665745 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You're sure you know what you're doing?
L665736 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Thank you, Master.
L665735 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ If you like -- just hurry!
L665734 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ It's always been one of my favorite names.
L665733 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Why?
L665732 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
L665731 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
L665730 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
L665729 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Can you imagine that brain in this body?
L665728 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ That's not bad.
L665727 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
L665726 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Hmm!
L665725 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
L665724 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Was he any good?
L665723 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I want that brain.
L665722 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
L665721 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Do you have the name I wrote down?
L665720 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I have a pretty good idea.
L665719 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
L665714 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Could be raining!
L665713 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ How?
L665712 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Could be worse!
L665711 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What a filthy job!
L665679 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
L665678 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Taking the book along?
L665674 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
L665673 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ 'How I Did It.'  Good title!
L665672 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
L665669 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Must be the music room.
L665668 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What is this place?
L665662 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
L665661 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Did you see anyone else down here?
L665656 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
L665655 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
L665654 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What?
L665653 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
L665650 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Did you hear that strange music?
L665649 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What?
L665648 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Did you hear that strange music??
L665647 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What?
L665646 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Did you hear that strange music?
L665645 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Just putting up some tea.
L665644 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But what you were doing?
L665643 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
L665642 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L665641 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Fro-derick!
L665640 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Aye-gor!
L665585 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I wonder what's got into them?
L665584 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Down!  Get down, you beasts!
L665580 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Home.
L665579 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Home!
L665577 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
L665576 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Wockers with the knockers???
L665575 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ The wockers with the knockers.
L665574 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What wockers?
L665573 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
L665572 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No.
L665571 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I thought you wanted to.
L665570 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Why are you talking like that?
L665569 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ There wolf!  There castle!
L665568 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L665567 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ There.
L665562 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What hump?
L665561 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
L665551 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, just the two.
L665550 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Are these your bags?
L665547 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ How do you do?
L665546 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
L665545 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm sure we will.
L665544 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
L665543 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
L665542 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
L665541 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But they told me it was Ee gor.
L665540 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
L665539 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You must be Igor.
L665538 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I see.
L665537 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.

L665535 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No, Fred ereck.
L665534 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ And do you also say Fro dereck?
L665533 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
L665532 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Are you putting me on?
L665531 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Fron kon steen!

L665945 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
L665944 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMMmmmmmm.

L665473 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Oh, just a little.
L665472 +++$+++ u9024 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ OLD VIOLINIST +++$+++ It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
L665471 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ May I see your violin?
L665470 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
L665469 +++$+++ u9024 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ OLD VIOLINIST +++$+++ Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
L665468 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What's that tune that you're playing
L666222 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
L666221 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
L666220 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.

L666215 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.

L666210 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
L666076 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ ...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
L666075 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes, I will.
L666074 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You've got to help me to remain faithful.
L666073 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L666072 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It wouldn't be fair to her.
L666071 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L666045 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
L666044 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Why don't we talk inside?
L666043 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes...yes, you have yours.
L666042 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ And I have mine.
L666041 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, I have mine.
L666040 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ But, after all, you have yours.
L666039 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
L666038 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ And Elizabeth has hers.
L666036 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
L666035 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
L666034 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Nor to Elizabeth.
L666033 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
L666032 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ What?
L666030 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Of course not.
L666029 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
L666028 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I know Frederick.
L666027 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
L666026 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I see what you mean.
L666025 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
L666024 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Not fooling around.
L666023 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
L666022 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
L666021 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
L666020 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
L666019 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Just passing through the night.
L665958 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
L665957 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
L665905 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Good night!
L665904 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Good night, Doctor.
L665898 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
L665897 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I think so.
L665896 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Did you do it?
L665894 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
L665893 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Give him the sedative!
L665892 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Are you serious??
L665891 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ All right -- give it to him!
L665874 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Stop -- singing!!!
L665873 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
L665870 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
L665869 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ This is not the finals -- just sing!
L665868 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I'd be so nervous.
L665867 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes -- quickly, dear!
L665866 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Me?  Sing?
L665865 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Do you think you can sing it?
L665862 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I think I'll...carry him.
L665861 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L665841 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ What do you think we should do?
L665840 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It looks that way.
L665804 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
L665803 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I think you've done it, master.
L665802 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Oh, Doctor!
L665799 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
L665798 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ It wasn't me.
L665777 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
L665776 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I thought it was wonderful.
L665775 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Reputation.  Reputation!
L665757 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
L665756 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Raise the platform, hurry!
L665755 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Right here?
L665752 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I know.
L665751 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes!
L665750 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ A god?
L665749 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
L665748 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
L665693 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ 'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
L665692 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ And look at this, Doctor!
L665691 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ 'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
L665677 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Perhaps we'd better leave.
L665676 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Oh, doctor!
L665665 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ But who was playing it?
L665664 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well, this explains the music.
L665663 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Look, Doctor!
L665659 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What a filthy mess.
L665658 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Ooh!
L665639 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
L665638 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
L665637 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
L665636 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
L665633 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I don't know.  It just woke me up.
L665632 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
L665631 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
L665630 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
L665629 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Inga, wake up!
L665628 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
L665627 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Inga!
L665625 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
L665624 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
L665623 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Would you like a sandwich?
L665622 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
L665621 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
L665620 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well...
L665619 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
L665618 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ We only arrived a few minutes ago.
L665617 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
L665616 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
L665615 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Are you busy?
L665565 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
L665564 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
L665559 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm not sure I...get your drift.
L665558 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
L665553 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
L665552 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Did you have a pleasant trip?
L665549 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ How nice.
L665548 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Extremely well.
L666169 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Do Something!  Stall them!
L666168 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Another fifteen seconds to go.
L666167 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
L666166 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
L666161 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
L666160 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ 
L666159 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
L666158 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
L666156 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
L666155 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What d'ya want to do to kill time?
L666154 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes.
L666153 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Three minutes to go!
L666152 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Four
L666151 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ How long is it so far?
L666150 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
L666149 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ How do you know they're done?
L665952 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
L665951 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
L665950 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.

L666368 +++$+++ u9025 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ BLOOMFIELD +++$+++ One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!

L666503 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
L666398 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
L666397 +++$+++ u9032 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ NORRIS-NEWMAN +++$+++ So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
L666396 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
L666395 +++$+++ u9032 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ NORRIS-NEWMAN +++$+++ If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
L666394 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
L666393 +++$+++ u9032 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ NORRIS-NEWMAN +++$+++ They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
L666392 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
L666391 +++$+++ u9032 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ NORRIS-NEWMAN +++$+++ Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
L666390 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ 1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
L666389 +++$+++ u9032 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ NORRIS-NEWMAN +++$+++ Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
L666388 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ An historical moment, Gentlemen.
L666488 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
L666487 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
L666484 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ I'm explaining my reasons.
L666483 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
L666482 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
L666481 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
L666480 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
L666358 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
L666357 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
L666250 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
L666249 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
L666248 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
L666247 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
L666246 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
L666547 +++$+++ u9029 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CREALOCK +++$+++ Certainly, Sin
L666546 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
L666486 +++$+++ u9029 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CREALOCK +++$+++ A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
L666485 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Yes?
L666461 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Thank you.
L666460 +++$+++ u9029 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CREALOCK +++$+++ The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
L666385 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
L666384 +++$+++ u9029 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CREALOCK +++$+++ Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
L666383 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
L666252 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ But will they make good use of them?
L666251 +++$+++ u9029 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CREALOCK +++$+++ Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
L666502 +++$+++ u9033 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ STUART SMITH +++$+++ Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
L666501 +++$+++ u9028 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ COGHILL +++$+++ Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
L666500 +++$+++ u9033 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ STUART SMITH +++$+++ Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
L666499 +++$+++ u9028 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ COGHILL +++$+++ How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
L666498 +++$+++ u9033 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ STUART SMITH +++$+++ Yes.
L666497 +++$+++ u9028 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ COGHILL +++$+++ Stuart?
L666576 +++$+++ u9031 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ MELVILL +++$+++ Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
L666575 +++$+++ u9028 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ COGHILL +++$+++ Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
L666327 +++$+++ u9031 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ MELVILL +++$+++ ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
L666326 +++$+++ u9028 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ COGHILL +++$+++ Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
L666325 +++$+++ u9031 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ MELVILL +++$+++ Which one?
L666324 +++$+++ u9028 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ COGHILL +++$+++ Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
L666264 +++$+++ u9031 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ MELVILL +++$+++ Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
L666263 +++$+++ u9028 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ COGHILL +++$+++ Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
L666262 +++$+++ u9031 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ MELVILL +++$+++ Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
L666522 +++$+++ u9034 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ VEREKER +++$+++ So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there. 
L666521 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
L666520 +++$+++ u9034 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ VEREKER +++$+++ Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
L666372 +++$+++ u9034 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ VEREKER +++$+++ I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
L666371 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
L666370 +++$+++ u9034 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ VEREKER +++$+++ I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
L666369 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ Your orders, Mr Vereker?
L666257 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
L666256 +++$+++ u9034 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ VEREKER +++$+++ Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
L650059 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
L650058 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
L650057 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
L650055 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ But why would they do that...?
L650054 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ With his hands!
L649960 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Two heartbeats.
L649959 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Two what...?
L649958 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ There are two.
L649957 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
L649956 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Are you alright...?  You look pale.
L649818 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
L649817 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
L649815 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ But you've not told Michael.
L649814 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I have seen him again.  Last night.
L649794 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
L649793 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
L649792 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Thank you for this honor, my dear.
L649661 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
L649660 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
L649651 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
L649650 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Then what is he...?
L649649 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
L650156 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
L650155 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Rowan...
L650152 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
L650151 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ What are you talk---
L650150 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
L650141 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Every day  twice.
L650140 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
L650138 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
L650137 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Nothing was ever more false.
L650136 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
L650053 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
L650052 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ "Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
L650051 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ What have the witches always asked of you...?
L650004 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
L650003 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Michael, Rowan should -
L650002 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don't tell Rowan about this.
L649752 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
L649751 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rowan.
L649750 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
L649749 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
L649653 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
L649652 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A what...?
L649520 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Come.  There is a lot to read
L649519 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
L649517 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
L649516 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
L649511 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
L649510 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
L649509 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
L649508 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
L649507 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
L649952 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
L649951 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
L649787 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
L649786 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Then you wear it.
L649785 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ 'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
L649784 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I don't want it.
L649783 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
L649719 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
L649718 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
L649717 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
L649705 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Nothing worse than a common tool.
L649704 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
L649703 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
L649702 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ He made that quite clear, yes.

And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
L650188 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!

L650103 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.

L650074 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ Then help me--- for his sake...
L650073 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I love Michael...

L650069 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
L650066 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
L650065 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
L650064 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
L650063 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I know that you're evil.

L649981 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ A girl...?
L649980 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
L649979 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
L649978 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ If that were true, I would not be here.
L649977 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Go away!  I don't want you here.
L649976 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ There is no one here but the dead.
L649975 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ I bring her flowers too.
L649974 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---

L649937 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
L649936 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
L649935 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ If you knew how I yearn for that...
L649934 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ To love, you must be able to feel.
L649933 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ It is from love.

L649763 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Their what...?
L649762 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
L649760 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
L649759 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ That's GREAT!
L649758 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
L649757 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ And I thought I was the mindreader.
L649756 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
L649755 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
L649754 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
L649733 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
L649732 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
L649729 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
L649728 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
L649727 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I don't think of us that way - ever.
L649726 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Ro, how long have we known each other.
L649725 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
L649724 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Maybe he's just - waiting...
L649723 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
L649722 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
L649709 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
L649708 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hello..

L649690 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
L649665 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
L649664 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What about your work back home...?
L649663 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
L649662 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
L649659 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.

L649656 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -
L649655 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
L649654 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
L649643 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
L649642 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
L649641 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
L649640 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
L649638 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
L649637 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
L649636 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
L649635 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
L649633 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ - a witch.
L649632 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ She - she said I - I was a ---
L649631 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
L649630 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You know...?
L649465 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.

L649463 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
L649462 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What about you coming down here...?
L649461 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
L649460 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What's wrong..?

L649418 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ We're quite a pair, you and I.
L649417 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
L649416 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ 
L649415 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
L649414 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ God knows, I'm intriguing.
L649413 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
L649412 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
L649411 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Seems more like a year than a month.
L649407 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
L649406 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Stop it.
L649405 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
L649404 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm serious.  You don't -
L649403 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
L649402 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
L649401 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
L649400 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ All I meant was -
L649399 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
L649397 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Captain's orders.
L649396 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Doctor's orders- - -?
L649395 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
L649394 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why don't you let at do that...?
L649392 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
L649391 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
L649390 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
L649389 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
L649386 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
L649385 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
L649384 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He fools around with his patients too.
L649383 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
L649380 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
L649379 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Too much... too fast...?
L649378 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
L649377 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Really...?  Your family there...?
L649376 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I was born, in New Orleans, too-
L649374 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You still feel that crazy...?
L649373 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
L649372 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ And whose houses do you design...?
L649371 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
L649367 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
L649366 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ It's unbelievable that you can do that.
L649365 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
L649364 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
L649363 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
L649362 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ What else did you see- Michael...?
L649361 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
L649360 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ you're very --- different.
L649359 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Yessssss...
L649358 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
L649357 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ HARDER!
L649356 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rowan...
L649355 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Harder...
L649348 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
L649347 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
L649346 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
L649345 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The one time I want it to work...
L649344 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Just one.  The bar's closed.
L649343 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
L649342 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ What do you see...?
L649339 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
L649338 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
L649336 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
L649335 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ My jury's still out on that,
L649334 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm glad you're around to say it.
L649333 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
L649332 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ 'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
L649331 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
L649330 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
L649329 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ They like you ------- kids.
L650085 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Just don't fall off any ladders.
L650084 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
L650019 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
L650018 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
L650017 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm getting --- left behind.
L649780 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
L649779 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You okay...?

L649676 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Wow...
L649674 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
L649673 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ 'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
L649672 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
L649671 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
L649315 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Go away, GODDAMNIT!
L649314 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You can't just -
L649313 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ On which planet...?
L649312 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
L649311 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
L649274 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I just - hate it when they're - finished.
L649273 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
L650087 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
L650086 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
L649910 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Is that what you were doing...?
L649909 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Is that a crack about our singing...?
L649908 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
L649684 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I like him.  He can stay.
L649683 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
L649682 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ He's got great hands.
L649681 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You really love this guy...?
L649680 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
L649679 +++$+++ u8883 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
L649678 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Rowan Mayfair.
L649743 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
L649742 +++$+++ u8882 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
L649741 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
L649740 +++$+++ u8882 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
L649739 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
L649738 +++$+++ u8882 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
L649737 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Papers...?
L649736 +++$+++ u8882 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ We'd better get to work on the papers.
L648533 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Then we both are.
L648532 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
L648531 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648530 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ No.  But once I heard...
L648529 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Did you?
L648528 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ A ghost?
L648527 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I started seeing things.
L648526 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L648525 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
L648524 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ So much.
L648523 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I miss you.
L648522 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
L648521 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Are you mad at me?
L648520 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I know he does.
L648519 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He loves you very much.  He just--
L648518 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
L648517 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's not true.
L648516 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
L648515 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, he wouldn't.
L648514 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Besides, Dad would have freaked.
L648512 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why?
L648511 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
L648510 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That was very good.
L647966 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
L647965 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of course you will.
L647964 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I'll come back all the time.
L647963 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know that.
L647962 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ It's only two hours away.
L647961 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes?
L647960 +++$+++ u8858 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Hey.
L647959 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Do you have a scarf?
L648459 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
L648458 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ That can't feel good.
L648457 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
L648456 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ What?
L648452 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
L648451 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ You were in an accident?
L648450 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
L648449 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Have you been hurt?
L648448 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
L648447 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ What do you think?  Guess.
L648446 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.
L648445 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Do you?
L648444 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She said, "You know."  That I know.
L648442 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
L648441 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ You're saying you willed these events to happen?
L648440 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
L648439 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ You think you influenced her?
L648438 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Isn't there something called group hysteria?
L648437 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Your friend saw them.
L648436 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes, but...
L648435 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
L648434 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Well, that's what we're here for.
L648433 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's happening to me?
L648361 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
L648360 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ How?
L648359 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Nope.
L648358 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Are you humoring me?
L648357 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
L648356 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You think that'll help?
L648355 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Try to communicate with her somehow.
L648354 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648352 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What do you think I should do?
L648351 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Fine.
L648350 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
L648349 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Do you have any idea who she is?
L648348 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Pretty.  She's a blond.
L648347 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ What does she look like?
L648346 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
L648345 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ How do you know it's a she?
L648344 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
L648342 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Mm-hmm.
L648341 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ These are good.
L648336 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You're joking.
L648335 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Fireball?
L648334 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
L648333 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Why is he worried?
L648332 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.
L648331 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Do you really think so?
L648330 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
L648329 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Your husband?
L648328 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Because he was worried about me.
L648327 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Then why did you?
L648326 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I didn't want to come.
L648325 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
L648324 +++$+++ u8860 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ DR. DRAYTON +++$+++ Who's idea was it?
L648582 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ The wives.
L648581 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Who's that?
L648580 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
L648579 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
L648578 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Toward the end.  You remember?
L648577 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ At the party.
L648576 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
L648575 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
L648574 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
L648573 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
L648572 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Uh-huh.  What can be?
L648571 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ I know how hard it can be sometimes.
L648570 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm sorry?
L648569 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing so well.
L648568 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Almost.
L648567 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
L648566 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
L648565 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ How're you holding up?
L648538 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
L648537 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I am.
L648536 +++$+++ u8866 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. TEMPLETON +++$+++ Of course.  You must be so proud.
L648428 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ I didn't kill my wife.
L648427 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Give me that shit.  Your wife.
L648426 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ Who?
L648194 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ I have to go.
L648193 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh-kay...
L648192 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ I don't know.
L648191 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ When...when will she be back?
L648190 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ She isn't here.
L648189 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Well maybe your wife...
L648188 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ This really isn't a good time.
L648187 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
L648186 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
L648185 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Um...
L648184 +++$+++ u8863 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MR. FEUR +++$+++ Yes?
L648484 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
L648483 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  No, I don't.
L648482 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ You must think I'm pathetic.
L648481 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
L648480 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Um...sure.
L648479 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
L648478 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648477 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Love.
L648475 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
L648474 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
L648473 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ No.
L648470 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
L648469 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Thank you.
L648468 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Your house is so beautiful.
L648467 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Very much.
L648466 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Would you like some iced tea?
L648465 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Right.  I'm sorry.
L648464 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ And then you weren't there.
L648463 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
L648462 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You do?
L648461 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I wanted to apologize.
L648043 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wait!  Don't go...
L648042 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
L648041 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
L648040 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ This fence...it's so...
L648039 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
L648038 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I've never even met you.
L648037 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's not...It's not like that.
L648036 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
L648035 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tell me.  I can help you.
L648034 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
L648033 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tell me.  Please.
L648032 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I can't, no, no, I can't...
L648031 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?  What are you afraid of?
L648030 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
L648029 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Who?  Your husband?
L648028 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
L648027 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I'm not...
L648026 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hello?
L648025 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Is everything alright?
L648024 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ I've seen you.  From the window.
L648023 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Um...yes.
L648022 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ You're the flower lady.
L648021 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
L648020 +++$+++ u8864 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FEUR +++$+++ Who are you?
L648659 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
L648658 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What was her major?
L648657 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of course.
L648656 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
L648655 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I should be going anyway.
L648654 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ They're calling me in to work.
L648651 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You must have been very proud.
L648650 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
L648648 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
L648647 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.
L648646 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Why are you here?
L648644 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
L648643 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She never mentioned her father.
L648642 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
L648641 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
L648640 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ You look a little old for a student.
L648639 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's fine.
L648638 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
L648635 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ She never mentioned you.
L648634 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Claire.
L648633 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ What's your name?
L648630 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Please leave me alone.
L648629 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, I don't.
L648628 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ You know where she is?
L648627 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
L648626 +++$+++ u8865 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ MRS. FRANK +++$+++ Yeah.
L648625 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mrs. Frank?
L648305 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
L648304 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ She got it.  Turned it down.
L648302 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
L648301 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's making this up.
L648300 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
L648299 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Do we have to?
L648298 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
L648297 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Stop.
L648296 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ You should have heard her play.
L648293 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh God...
L648292 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
L648291 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We were suite mates.
L648290 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ I came in from my room...
L648289 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He was so pissed.
L648288 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ ...just so she could cut them off.
L648287 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I didn't sleep with him.
L648286 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Anyway, Claire slept with him...
L648285 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He looked like one of the Monkees.
L648282 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We know each other.
L648281 +++$+++ u8861 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ This is...
L648280 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wow.
L648805 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
L648804 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know...
L648803 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
L648802 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
L648801 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I guess not.
L648800 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
L648799 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody he was lying.
L648798 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Did he say that?
L648797 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
L648770 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What is it?
L648769 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
L648768 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Like what?
L648767 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
L648766 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
L648765 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
L648764 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I can't believe this is happening.
L648763 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I know.
L648762 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody, she tried to kill him.
L648750 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
L648749 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
L648748 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
L648747 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ If she was dangerous before--
L648746 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.
L648745 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L648744 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
L648743 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.
L648742 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I'm a terrible friend.
L648741 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ All of us.
L648740 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
L648739 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
L648738 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
L648737 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
L648736 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
L648735 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Relieved?
L648734 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
L648733 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why?
L648732 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
L648731 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
L648730 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Adamant?
L648729 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I was down in Adamant...
L648728 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh God...you knew.
L648564 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
L648563 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.
L648562 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Please.
L648561 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ But Claire--
L648560 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
L648559 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
L648558 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hartford?
L648557 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
L648556 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Did I?
L648555 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Something was there.  You saw it.
L648554 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
L648553 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Then what was it?
L648552 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
L648551 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What?
L648550 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody, she's alive.
L648549 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Does Norman know?
L648548 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
L648547 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's alright.
L648546 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
L648545 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I think so
L648544 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Are you okay?
L648389 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody, wait.
L648388 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I have to go.
L648383 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
L648382 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Mef?  What's Mef?
L648381 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ M-E...
L648380 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh...
L648375 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Shhh.
L648374 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nothing's happening.
L648371 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.
L648370 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
L648369 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ This.
L648368 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ The planchette?
L648367 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Place your fingers on the planchette.
L648364 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
L648363 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Sit down here.
L648218 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
L648217 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wow.  I'm losing it.
L648215 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I don't...
L648214 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ In the window.  Norman's at work.
L648213 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What?
L648212 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Someone's there.
L648209 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Please.  That's all I need.
L648208 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
L648207 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...no...no...no...
L648206 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Telling you...
L648205 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody, no...
L648204 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Seance.
L648203 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648202 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Know what I think?
L648199 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
L648198 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ You think he killed her?
L648101 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You got it.
L648100 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
L648099 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Absolutely.
L648098 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
L648097 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's niiice.
L648096 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Yep.
L648095 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh my god.  You bought it.
L648094 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
L648093 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Thanks, but I'm fine.
L648092 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
L648091 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You're discussing me with your psychic?
L648090 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
L648089 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody--
L648088 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Kambucha mushroom tea...
L648087 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What is it?
L648086 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
L648085 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
L648084 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Well good.  So you're human.
L648083 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Okay, I'm a little tender.
L648082 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
L648081 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why does everyone find that so surprising?
L648080 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ You are?
L648079 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Good.  I'm good.
L648078 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ How you holding up?
L648842 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ MADISON!
L648841 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648840 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mauduh...
L648839 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Shhhh.
L648838 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mmmuh...
L648821 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
L648820 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L648819 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
L648818 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
L648817 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
L648816 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
L648811 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
L648810 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I know.
L648809 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You don't have to do that.
L648808 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm cooking you dinner.
L648807 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nothing.
L648806 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What's that for?
L648795 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
L648794 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Don't think so.
L648793 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Do you know it?
L648792 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Huh.
L648791 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
L648790 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648789 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Adamant.
L648788 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
L648787 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Look for antiques...
L648786 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
L648785 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ The leaves...
L648781 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire...
L648780 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
L648779 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How can you be sure?
L648778 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She can't be here without me.
L648777 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648776 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's gone.
L648775 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
L648774 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's alright.
L648773 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We have to get out of here.
L648723 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
L648722 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We don't know that for sure.
L648721 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She did it.
L648718 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ How did she know where it was?
L648717 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
L648711 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Get out of my way.
L648710 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire...
L648709 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You should have tried harder.
L648708 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I tried to break it off!
L648707 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm not going to listen to this.
L648706 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
L648705 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Stop...
L648704 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
L648703 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Leave her out of this!
L648702 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ To Caitlin!!
L648701 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Who?
L648700 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
L648699 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
L648698 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I never asked you to quit!
L648697 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
L648696 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, please don't...
L648693 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
L648692 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ That's not what I'm sayi--
L648691 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ So you fucked a student?!
L648690 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It was last year.  We were having troubles.
L648689 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
L648688 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Oh God...
L648687 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
L648686 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire--
L648685 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I was there.
L648684 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648683 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ "You know..."
L648681 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ STOP IT!
L648680 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Your wife...
L648679 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Who?
L648678 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I think she's starting to suspect something.
L648677 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
L648676 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't like this, this...
L648675 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Since when?
L648674 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's too rough.
L648673 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's the matter?
L648672 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Ow!
L648669 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wouldn't go that far.
L648668 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I take it your not mad at me.
L648619 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ STOP IT!
L648618 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's Madison Fra--
L648617 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...Please stop...
L648616 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...I'm positive this time...
L648615 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Stop...
L648614 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
L648613 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes.  The ghost.
L648612 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ The...
L648611 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
L648610 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
L648609 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Not personally.
L648608 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I may have seen her on campus.
L648596 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's wrong with me?
L648595 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
L648594 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ But I don't remember.
L648593 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
L648592 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
L648591 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
L648590 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ In the living room...
L648589 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
L648588 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I...
L648587 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You dropped a glass.
L648586 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
L648585 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You don't remember?
L648500 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You told me that I was...
L648499 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We walked all night...
L648498 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I felt you...looking through me...
L648497 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
L648496 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
L648495 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know I am.
L648494 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Are you glad?  I'm glad.
L648493 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648491 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Call ya later.
L648490 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yep.
L648489 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Do I have everything?
L648488 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Really big bed.
L648487 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
L648486 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
L648430 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Then where is she?
L648429 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm sorry...
L648420 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, please...
L648419 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
L648418 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I will NOT.
L648417 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Keep your voice down.
L648414 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
L648413 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Sweetheart--
L648412 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
L648411 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ But then you've been so much better...
L648410 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ The accident...?
L648409 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
L648408 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Sabotage?
L648407 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
L648406 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What are you...?  No.
L648405 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
L648404 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648402 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
L648401 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How did you--
L648400 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
L648399 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Who did?
L648398 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We had a seance.
L648397 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How do you know this?
L648396 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
L648395 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ This is the Feur thing?
L648394 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
L648393 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What are you doing out here?
L648323 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
L648322 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Are you lonely?
L648321 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
L648320 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I never said...
L648319 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
L648318 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
L648315 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What can it hurt to talk to someone?
L648314 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman...
L648313 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Harvey says he's amazing.
L648312 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't need a shrink.
L648272 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Well, that's a relief.
L648271 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ There we go.
L648270 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We're going to be fine.
L648269 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
L648268 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You're not at the center.
L648267 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Five minutes?
L648266 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
L648265 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L648264 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
L648263 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...like it never even happened...
L648262 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...Don't get all...
L648261 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ When you do this, I swear...
L648259 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
L648258 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tonight?
L648257 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
L648256 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh.
L648255 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
L648254 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ When?
L648253 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
L648252 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Dressed?
L648251 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
L648250 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
L648249 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
L648248 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Maybe.  Point is...not me.
L648247 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
L648246 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I didn't do that.
L648245 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What am I looking at?
L648244 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ See?
L648243 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
L648242 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
L648241 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Where is she then?
L648236 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's a ghost.
L648235 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
L648234 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
L648233 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ A flare?
L648232 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's a flare.
L648231 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  Look!  In the window.
L648230 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Our house.
L648229 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
L648228 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
L648227 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
L648226 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648225 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He killed her.
L648223 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Shhhh.
L648222 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What's going on, Claire?
L648221 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Get down!  He'll see.
L648178 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Huh.
L648177 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
L648176 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Did you call about the Feurs?
L648175 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Sorry.  You understand.
L648172 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
L648171 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You didn't?
L648170 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?  No.  No.
L648169 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did you tell her?
L648168 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
L648167 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
L648166 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm so sorry.
L648165 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ "...for my father."
L648164 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's...
L648163 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ "...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
L648162 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh, no...
L648161 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ "...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
L648160 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Well, that's nice.
L648159 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
L648158 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wow.
L648157 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
L648156 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You're kidding.
L648155 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
L648154 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know what that does to me.
L648153 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
L648152 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Yep.
L648151 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You are so brilliant.
L648150 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I think so.  Maybe.
L648149 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Really?
L648148 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Think I may have cracked it.
L648147 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
L648146 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
L648141 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.  Just...whispering.
L648140 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What kind of whispering?
L648139 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
L648138 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Of course.
L648137 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
L648136 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did you call the police?
L648135 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ In the house.  I was scared.
L648134 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What do you mean?  Some noises where?
L648133 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
L648132 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L648113 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
L648112 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire?
L648110 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, no.  It's fine.
L648109 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Unless you need me to come home...
L648108 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh.
L648107 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
L648106 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hi.
L648075 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Is it gone?
L648074 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
L648071 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hurry...
L648070 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Mmnph.
L648069 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman, you have to look at this!
L648066 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Promise?
L648065 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
L648064 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I just wish you could have heard her.
L648063 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's what I've been working for.
L648062 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know.
L648061 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
L648060 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'd never be able to live with mysel--
L648059 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire...
L648058 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ But what if something happens?
L648057 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
L648056 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's not what I'm sug--
L648055 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
L648054 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ To make sure she's all right.
L648053 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Why?
L648052 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
L648051 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Remember how we were?
L648050 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
L648049 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
L648048 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ More or less.
L648047 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did she say that?
L648046 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of him I think.
L648045 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Of what?
L648014 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'll be there.
L648013 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ After that.
L648012 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
L648011 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tomorrow.
L648010 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Maybe we should just...
L648009 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mmm.
L648008 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And we moved out here for the quiet.
L648004 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Shhh.
L648003 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did you...
L648002 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yup.
L648001 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Wanna fool around?
L648000 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nope.
L647999 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Tired?
L647998 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know.
L647997 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's just us now.
L647996 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We did.
L647995 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
L647994 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
L647993 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You are...
L647992 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
L647991 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know what I mean.
L647990 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Not the focus.
L647989 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's just she's been the focus for a while.
L647988 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I am, really.
L647987 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's okay if you're not.
L647986 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Fine.
L647985 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How are you?
L647984 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
L647983 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ If you have to work...
L647982 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Nice.  Almost done.
L647981 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
L647980 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How is it?
L647979 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
L647978 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Whatcha reading?
L647957 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Three o'clock.

L647947 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman Spencer.
L647946 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ When's she out of here?
L647944 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
L647943 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's awake.
L647942 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
L647941 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's their name?

L649089 +++$+++ u8869 +++$+++ m602 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ :Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
L649088 +++$+++ u8868 +++$+++ m602 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ :What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
L649087 +++$+++ u8869 +++$+++ m602 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ :Well, they are.
L649086 +++$+++ u8868 +++$+++ m602 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ :Would you stop it!
L649085 +++$+++ u8869 +++$+++ m602 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ :No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
L649084 +++$+++ u8868 +++$+++ m602 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ :What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?

N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours.

But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
L643986 +++$+++ u8820 +++$+++ m598 +++$+++ MR. YOUNG +++$+++ I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.

L644770 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
L644769 +++$+++ u8838 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LYNCH +++$+++ Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
L644768 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
L644767 +++$+++ u8838 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LYNCH +++$+++ If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
L644766 +++$+++ u8838 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LYNCH +++$+++ Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
L644765 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ He's lying.

L645475 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
L645474 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
L645473 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
L645355 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Get the hell out!
L645354 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
L645353 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Then get out and close it behind you.
L645352 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Hey the door was open.
L645351 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
L645350 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
L645216 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
L645215 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What's going on?
L645024 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Anacott Steel. Buy it.
L645023 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ What the hell...
L644923 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton.
L644922 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ All right, I owe you one Marv.
L644921 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
L644920 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
L644919 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
L644896 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
L644895 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Got a little action there, eh buddy?
L644890 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
L644889 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
L644887 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
L644886 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...gotta read my reports.
L644885 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ ...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
L644881 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
L644880 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, but he didn't see me.
L644879 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ ...well, see him?
L644780 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
L644779 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ It concerns his future!
L644778 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
L644777 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
L644776 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
L644775 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
L644774 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie.
L644773 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
L644772 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
L644750 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
L644749 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
L644748 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
L644747 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Yeah, where's your machine gun.
L644746 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
L645549 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
L645548 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
L645544 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
L645543 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I guess it's time to hit the road.
L645542 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
L645541 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Another cup of coffee?
L645435 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ You speak for me, son.
L645434 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Your words, not mine...
L645332 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
L645331 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
L645330 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
L645329 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
L645328 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
L645327 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
L645326 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
L645325 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
L645324 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
L645290 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I met them before you were born.
L645289 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
L645021 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
L645020 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
L645019 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
L645018 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Whatever night you like.
L645017 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
L645016 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
L645014 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
L645013 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
L645012 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
L645011 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
L645010 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
L645008 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
L645007 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Alright. Why so pissed?
L645006 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Don't start, alright.
L645005 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
L645004 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ What brings you out here...
L644821 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
L644820 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The FAA announcement.
L644819 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ About what?
L644818 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You sure about this FAA announcement?
L644817 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad...
L644816 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
L644815 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's great Dad.
L644814 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right.
L644813 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...Work okay?
L644812 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
L644811 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How's Mom?
L644810 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
L644809 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Not in here Dad... please. Later.
L644808 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ...Got a 100 on me, you...
L644807 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
L644806 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
L644805 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
L644804 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
L644803 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ 50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
L644802 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
L644801 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
L644800 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
L644799 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
L644798 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
L644797 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Coulda been a contender.
L644796 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
L644795 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
L644794 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Speak English will ya.
L644793 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
L644792 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
L644790 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
L644789 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
L644878 +++$+++ u8841 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ ...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
L644877 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...thanks Natalie.
L644829 +++$+++ u8841 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
L644828 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
L644827 +++$+++ u8841 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
L644826 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
L644825 +++$+++ u8841 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L644824 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
L645349 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
L645348 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ I don't know anything!
L645347 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
L645346 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ You sure?
L645345 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
L645344 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ What if they call him?
L645343 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
L645342 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ What if he asks where I got the money?
L645341 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
L645340 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
L645339 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What'd you tell him?
L645338 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ ...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
L645252 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
L645251 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
L644959 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
L644958 +++$+++ u8837 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ So you're hot on this stock?
L644957 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
L644956 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
L644955 +++$+++ u8837 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
L644954 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
L644953 +++$+++ u8837 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
L644952 +++$+++ u8837 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
L644951 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So, where are we going?
L644950 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ We are?
L644949 +++$+++ u8837 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
L644948 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
L644947 +++$+++ u8837 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
L645364 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
L645363 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ He never told me...
L645362 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
L645360 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
L645359 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
L645358 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
L645357 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ ...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
L645356 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So what's the problem?
L645254 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ All right, Bud... let's do it.
L645253 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
L645164 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
L645163 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
L645162 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ ...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
L645161 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
L645160 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Yeah, right...
L645159 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
L645158 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
L645157 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
L645156 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Okay.
L645155 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
L645154 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
L645153 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ "What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
L645152 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ What was that?
L645151 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Nah, she asked the wrong question.
L645150 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
L645149 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
L645148 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
L645532 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
L645531 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Gordon.
L645530 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Hello Bud.
L645518 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Dump it.
L645517 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
L645393 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Are you with me Buddy?
L645392 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...I can't make it tonight.
L645391 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
L645390 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Obviously...
L645389 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
L645388 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How much is enough Gordon?
L645387 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
L645386 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
L645385 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
L645384 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
L645383 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
L645382 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Why do you need to wreck this company?
L645381 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
L645380 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
L645379 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
L645378 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
L645377 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ What the hell do you want?
L645375 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm sorry, this can't wait.
L645374 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
L645319 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
L645318 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Now, wait a minute, Dad...
L645292 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
L645291 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
L645283 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
L645282 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
L645281 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ What makes you think you can?
L645280 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
L645279 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ What does that mean?
L645278 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
L645277 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
L645276 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
L645273 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
L645272 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
L645186 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
L645185 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
L645175 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
L645174 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How much?
L645173 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
L645147 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work.
L645146 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...Gordon.
L645145 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
L645144 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
L645143 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
L645141 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You're learning, sport...
L645140 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ "All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
L645139 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
L645133 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
L645132 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
L645123 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
L645122 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I guess I'll head back...
L645068 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Allright. Wait here...
L645067 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
L645063 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
L645062 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
L645061 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
L645060 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
L645059 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
L645056 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
L645055 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
L644990 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
L644989 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What about hard work?
L644988 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
L644987 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
L644986 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
L644985 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't understand.
L644984 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
L644983 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I remember that deal. You were involved?
L644982 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
L644981 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ 'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
L644980 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Know the name?
L644976 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes...
L644975 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
L644974 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What? How do you know about my father?
L644973 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
L644972 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand.
L644971 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
L644970 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
L644968 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
L644967 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
L644966 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
L644945 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Excuse me sir.
L644944 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
L644943 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
L644939 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
L644938 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No sir, that would've been illegal...
L644937 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
L644936 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
L644935 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
L644934 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...I can't even see it...
L644933 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
L644929 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
L644928 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Hi sport.
L644874 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
L644873 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ My home number's on the back...
L644868 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
L644867 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ How do you know?
L644866 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
L644865 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
L644864 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
L644863 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
L644855 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
L644854 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
L644853 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
L644852 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
L644851 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
L644850 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
L644849 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
L644848 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Jackson, Steinem...
L644847 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ So what firm you with, pal?
L644846 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
L644845 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
L644844 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh no, no...
L644843 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
L644841 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
L644840 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
L645556 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
L645555 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Why?
L645554 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Hi.
L645417 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Get the hell out!
L645416 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
L645413 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
L645412 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
L645411 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
L645409 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What the hell's that supposed to mean?
L645408 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
L645407 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
L645406 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
L645405 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
L645404 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
L645403 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
L645402 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
L645401 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
L645400 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
L645270 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
L645269 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
L645268 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
L645267 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
L645266 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
L645265 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
L645264 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
L645263 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.
L645262 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ ...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
L645261 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
L645246 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I'll let you know.
L645245 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
L645244 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Do you think you're ready?
L645243 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
L645242 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
L645241 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
L645240 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
L645239 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
L645238 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
L645237 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
L645236 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
L645235 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ ...isn't it perfect!
L645207 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
L645206 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I don't.
L645205 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, why stop at that?
L645204 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ ...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
L645203 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ And what do you want?
L645202 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
L645201 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
L645200 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
L645199 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, almost...
L645198 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ If I could have anything... this would almost do.
L645178 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
L645177 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
L645176 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
L645111 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Only if I want something bad enough.
L645110 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You really do believe in destiny?
L645109 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So. See you Friday.
L645108 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
L645107 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
L645106 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Break it.
L645105 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ What if I have a previous engagement?
L645104 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
L645103 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
L645102 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Upper West Side.
L645101 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Where is it?
L645100 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
L645099 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
L645098 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I gather you're a decorator.
L645097 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
L645096 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
L645095 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
L645094 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You could have a great beach house for that.
L645093 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
L645092 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
L645091 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
L645090 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
L645089 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Aha. Poet or philosopher?
L645088 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
L645087 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Oh yes, I remember you.
L645086 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
L645085 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Excuse me.
L645084 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
L645425 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh Christ!
L645424 +++$+++ u8832 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
L645421 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
L645420 +++$+++ u8832 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Bud! Where you been the last two days?
L644963 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...how do you know? You wish...
L644962 +++$+++ u8832 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ You were never that innocent sugarpie.
L644961 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Any better and I'd be guilty.
L644960 +++$+++ u8832 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Morning Buddy, you look happy.
L644738 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
L644737 +++$+++ u8832 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ How you doing Buddy?
L645221 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
L645220 +++$+++ u8839 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MANNHEIM +++$+++ You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
L645031 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
L645030 +++$+++ u8839 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MANNHEIM +++$+++ Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
L645029 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
L645028 +++$+++ u8839 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MANNHEIM +++$+++ No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
L645027 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
L644918 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Old values. Buy.
L644917 +++$+++ u8839 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MANNHEIM +++$+++ Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
L644916 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
L644752 +++$+++ u8839 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MANNHEIM +++$+++ Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
L644751 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
L645322 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
L645321 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
L645317 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
L645316 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
L645315 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
L645314 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
L645295 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
L645294 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
L645456 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
L645455 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
L645454 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
L645453 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
L645452 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
L645451 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I can't...and I won't.
L645450 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
L645449 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Because I don't want to see him hurt.
L645448 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
L645447 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
L645446 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
L645445 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You told him about us?
L645444 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ It's over you, Gordon.
L645443 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
L645442 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
L645441 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
L645440 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
L645439 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
L645438 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
L644872 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
L644871 +++$+++ u8842 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ OLLIE +++$+++ And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
L644870 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
L644869 +++$+++ u8842 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ OLLIE +++$+++ ... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
L644858 +++$+++ u8842 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ OLLIE +++$+++ He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
L644857 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
L644835 +++$+++ u8842 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ OLLIE +++$+++ You got it, G.G.
L644834 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
L645138 +++$+++ u8844 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILDMAN +++$+++ Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
L645137 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
L645130 +++$+++ u8844 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILDMAN +++$+++ I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
L645129 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
L645128 +++$+++ u8844 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILDMAN +++$+++ No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
L645127 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
L645126 +++$+++ u8844 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILDMAN +++$+++ Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
L645125 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
L645506 +++$+++ u8845 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILMORE +++$+++ We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
L645505 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
L645498 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
L645497 +++$+++ u8845 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILMORE +++$+++ We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
L645311 +++$+++ u8845 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILMORE +++$+++ If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
L645310 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Cards are on the table. What do you think?
L645306 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
L645305 +++$+++ u8845 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILMORE +++$+++ Are you prepared to put that in writing?
L645301 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
L645300 +++$+++ u8845 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ WILMORE +++$+++ With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
L646115 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ A body.  I mean we're talking major body
L646114 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What's that?
L646113 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ But he still has something Mark hasn't.
L646112 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ But?
L646111 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ So why are you dating Jonathan?
L646110 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ Yeah 
L646109 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, OK
L646108 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
L646107 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ Businessman!
L646106 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Businessman?
L646105 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
L646104 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ He did?
L646103 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
L646102 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ He still likes you
L646101 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ With Mark?
L646100 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
L646421 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
L646420 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
L646180 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Ok toots, I will.
L646179 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
L646173 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Suffer?  We're living in America.
L646172 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
L646171 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
L646170 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
L646169 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
L646168 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
L646167 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ About what?  About us.
L646166 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
L646162 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ It's eleven forty-five let's go
L646161 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Anybody want another drink?
L646144 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
L646143 +++$+++ u8846 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ CHINA +++$+++ Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
L646322 +++$+++ u8853 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MR LINCOLN +++$+++ Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
L646321 +++$+++ u8847 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ INSPECTOR ROBERTS +++$+++ Yes, I guess you're right
L646320 +++$+++ u8847 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ INSPECTOR ROBERTS +++$+++ It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
L646319 +++$+++ u8853 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MR LINCOLN +++$+++ Would you like a closer look?
L646318 +++$+++ u8847 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ INSPECTOR ROBERTS +++$+++ Hmm.
L646317 +++$+++ u8853 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MR LINCOLN +++$+++ Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.

L646269 +++$+++ u8849 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ A party at a waxwork huh?
L646268 +++$+++ u8854 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MRS WEBSTER +++$+++ She went to a waxwork party
L646267 +++$+++ u8849 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ No?

L646255 +++$+++ u8850 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ I hope you enjoyed your visit.
L646193 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Uh, wrong picture Tony.
L646192 +++$+++ u8850 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
L646401 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Go away.
L646400 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Sarah listen to me.
L646365 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ China
L646364 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Well, it all started when a friend and I
L646343 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
L646342 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Well?
L646340 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Who's is all this?
L646339 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
L646334 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Big deal!
L646333 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
L646332 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Oh that explains everything.
L646331 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
L646330 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
L646300 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ A little?
L646299 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
L646298 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ That's not what you said last night.
L646297 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
L646286 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
L646285 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Come on.
L646284 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
L646283 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No Mark. MARK Why not?
L646263 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I know what you mean.
L646262 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
L646261 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Then why do you still like her?
L646254 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
L646253 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
L646252 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ What?  Tony and China, together?
L646251 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
L646247 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
L646246 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Haven't we been doing our homework.
L646204 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ This. is killer.
L646203 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
L646202 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ This time I really don't see anyone man.
L646190 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Right behind you.
L646189 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Anyone else not coming?
L646183 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Right.
L646182 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Safety in numbers man.
L646181 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
L646138 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
L646137 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
L646376 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ Maybe before the event, never after.
L646375 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Can this be stopped?
L646374 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
L646373 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
L646372 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
L646371 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Sell my soul?
L646370 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
L646368 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Six six and six
L646367 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ Well divide 18 into three
L646366 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Well?
L646362 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
L646361 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ So Mark, what's so urgent?
L646360 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ No thank you sir we're fine.
L646358 +++$+++ u8856 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SIR WILFRED +++$+++ Hi there Sarah
L646357 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
L646089 +++$+++ u8852 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARKS MOTHER +++$+++ I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
L646088 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
L646087 +++$+++ u8852 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARKS MOTHER +++$+++ When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
L646086 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
L646085 +++$+++ u8852 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARKS MOTHER +++$+++ Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
L646084 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
L646083 +++$+++ u8852 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARKS MOTHER +++$+++ Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
L646082 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ They're all human beings
L646081 +++$+++ u8852 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARKS MOTHER +++$+++ One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
L646080 +++$+++ u8851 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Mom.
L646079 +++$+++ u8852 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ MARKS MOTHER +++$+++ Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
L646177 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
L646176 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
L646160 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ YES!
L646159 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
L646158 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
L646146 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You guys are being real assholes
L646145 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
L646142 +++$+++ u8857 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
L646141 +++$+++ u8855 +++$+++ m600 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Stop saying things so loud!
L639008 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ I'll give you another complication: he still is.
L639007 +++$+++ u8758 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Ah? That complicates the problem.
L639006 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
L639005 +++$+++ u8758 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
L639004 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ He won't talk.
L639003 +++$+++ u8758 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
L639002 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
L638990 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
L638989 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I -- I --
L638988 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
L638659 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
L638658 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why did she never tell her daughter?
L638657 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
L638656 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
L638655 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ She is not my wife.
L638654 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ And when she goes to those places...
L638653 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Nothing.
L638652 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
L638651 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
L638650 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
L638649 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
L638648 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
L638647 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
L638646 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
L638645 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ But you knew about this.
L638644 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
L638643 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ There are things you didn't tell me.
L638642 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Yes.
L638641 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ That's Carlotta Valdes.
L638640 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
L638553 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
L638552 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Ernie's.
L638551 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
L638550 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How can I see her, to know her?
L638549 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
L638548 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ It's not my line.
L638547 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ I want you.
L638546 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
L638545 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
L638544 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Have you talked to the doctors at all?
L638543 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
L638542 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well?
L638541 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
L638540 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where'd she go?
L638539 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
L638538 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How often does this happen?
L638537 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
L638536 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No.
L638535 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
L638534 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I didn't mean to be that rough.
L638533 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
L638532 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
L638531 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
L638530 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No.
L638529 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
L638528 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Someone dead.
L638527 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ From whom?
L638526 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
L638525 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Then?
L638524 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Not what you think. We're very happily married.
L638521 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
L638520 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Would you like a drink now?
L638519 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
L638518 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
L638517 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, I'm all right.
L638516 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Shouldn't you be sitting down?
L638515 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
L638514 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Like all this.
L638513 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
L638512 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ And you like it.
L638511 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Almost a year.
L638510 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How long have you been back?
L638509 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
L638508 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You don't have to do it for a living.
L638507 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ No, to be honest, I find it dull.
L638506 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Interesting business.
L638505 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ I married into it.
L638504 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
L638735 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
L638734 +++$+++ u8760 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER'S VOICE +++$+++ Did she hurt herself?
L638733 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Hello?
L638732 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ She... went into the Bay.
L638731 +++$+++ u8760 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER'S VOICE +++$+++ What happened?
L638730 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
L638729 +++$+++ u8760 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER'S VOICE +++$+++ Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
L638728 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Hello.
L639285 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
L639284 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Love me... keep me safe...
L639283 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
L639282 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I loved you, Madeleine.
L639281 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L639280 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
L639279 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Some money.
L639278 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
L639274 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
L639273 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L639272 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I made it.
L639271 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ We'll find him.
L639270 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I don't know... Switzerland?
L639269 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
L639268 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Your accident...
L639267 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
L639266 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Yes!
L639265 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
L639264 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
L639263 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
L639262 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
L639261 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Dead. He'd broken her neck.
L639260 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
L639259 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Yes!
L639258 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
L639257 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Scottie, please...!
L639256 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm going to. It's my second chance.
L639255 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You can't. You're afraid!
L639254 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ We're going up the tower.
L639253 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No! Let me go!
L639252 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
L639249 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
L639248 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No!
L639247 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
L639246 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Take me away...
L639245 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
L639238 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ -- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did.
L639237 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Scottie --
L639236 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ ...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
L639234 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
L639233 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'm scared.
L639232 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
L639231 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?
L639230 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I need you.
L639229 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
L639228 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Madeleine died here.
L639227 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But why? Why here?
L639226 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
L639225 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Scottie, why are we here?
L639223 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ To complete my cure.
L639222 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Where are you going?
L639221 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No, it's all right.
L639220 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
L639219 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ We're going awfully far.
L639213 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Oh, yeah. There.
L639212 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Can't you see?
L639211 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How does it work?
L639210 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Scottie!
L639209 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ All in good time.
L639208 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
L639207 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
L639205 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
L639204 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, Ernie's is fine.
L639203 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
L639202 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Too late. I've got my face on.
L639201 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ That's what I had in mind.
L639200 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh, no. You'll muss me.
L639199 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Come here.
L639198 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Is that the best you can do?
L639197 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Mmmm.
L639195 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Well, after all, it's "our place."
L639194 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
L639193 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Ernie's?
L639192 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Wherever you'd like...
L639191 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Where shall we go for dinner?
L639188 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ We tried it. It didn't suit me.
L639187 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
L639186 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Well?
L639177 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
L639176 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes.
L639175 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
L639174 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Judy, please it can't matter to you...
L639173 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Ah, no!
L639172 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ The color of your hair...
L639170 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes. Yes, I do.
L639169 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You don't even want to touch me.
L639168 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
L639167 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
L639166 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
L639165 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go...
L639164 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You can.
L639163 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
L639147 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ We'll take it! Will it fit?
L639146 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I don't like it!
L639143 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
L639142 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
L639141 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
L639136 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
L639135 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Judy --
L639134 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
L639133 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
L639132 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You want me to dress like her?
L639129 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But why?
L639128 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ They're none of them right.
L639127 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
L639126 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm trying to buy you a suit.
L639125 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Scottie, what are you doing?
L639123 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, it's not right.
L639122 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But I like that one, Scottie.
L639118 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I want to! Come on!
L639117 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But Scottie, you don't have to!
L639116 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
L639115 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Honest?
L639114 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
L639109 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Yes --
L639108 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
L639107 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I like that one.
L639105 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
L639104 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Will you, Judy?
L639103 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Please! And don't look at me.
L639102 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?!
L639101 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
L639099 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ That's not very complimentary, either.
L639098 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No.
L639097 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
L639096 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes.
L639095 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
L639094 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I just want to see you as much as I can!
L639093 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No? Then what?
L639092 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No.
L639091 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
L639090 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, Judy, you don't understand.
L639089 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
L639088 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'll take care of you.
L639087 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
L639086 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Don't go.
L639085 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
L639084 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Tomorrow morning.
L639083 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Tomorrow night? Well --
L639082 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Can I see you tomorrow?
L639081 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Thank you again. Good-night.
L639078 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Okay.
L639077 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Mmm.
L639076 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ An hour?
L639075 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
L639074 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
L639073 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
L639072 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
L639071 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Because I remind you of her?
L639070 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Just dinner.
L639069 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Dinner... and what else?
L639068 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Then will you for me?
L639067 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No, you don't owe me anything.
L639066 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
L639065 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?
L639064 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Will you have dinner with me?
L639056 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
L639055 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I want to know who you are.
L639054 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Listen, what is this? What do you want?
L639053 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Salina, Kansas!
L639052 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ But before! Where did you live before!?!
L639051 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I told you! Right here!
L639050 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
L639049 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ About three years.
L639048 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ But you haven't lived here long.
L639047 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ It's a place to live, that's all.
L639046 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ -- and how you happen to be living here.
L639045 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
L639044 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Who you are --
L639043 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Judy Barton.
L639042 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Your name. And --
L639041 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ What do you want to know?
L639040 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
L639039 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You won't have to.
L639038 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
L639036 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Let me come in.
L639035 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
L639034 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You're not far wrong.
L639033 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
L639031 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?
L639030 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You.
L639029 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ What about?
L639028 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Just let me talk to you.
L639027 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
L639026 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
L639025 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
L639024 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ 0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
L639023 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
L639022 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Do you live here in the hotel?
L639021 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
L639020 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
L639019 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ My name is John Ferguson, and --
L639018 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ What for? Who are you?
L639017 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Could I ask you a couple of questions?
L638975 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
L638974 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why?
L638973 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Let me go into the church alone.
L638972 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I won't lose you.
L638971 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
L638970 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes.
L638969 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You believe that I love you?
L638968 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Madeleine!!
L638967 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Let me go! Let me go!!
L638966 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
L638965 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
L638963 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Please let me go.
L638962 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Madeleine --
L638961 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ To the church, I must go there.
L638960 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where?
L638959 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Let me go.
L638958 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why?
L638957 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You can't.
L638956 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
L638953 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Too late... there's something I must do...
L638952 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No... we're together...
L638951 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I love you too... too late... too late...
L638950 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ My love... because I love you.
L638944 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
L638943 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes.
L638942 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ And it's a all real.
L638941 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Here with you.
L638933 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
L638932 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
L638928 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
L638927 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
L638926 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, never!
L638925 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You've been there before. You've seen it.
L638924 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ It's all there. It's no dream.
L638923 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes?! But --
L638922 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ -- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
L638921 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
L638920 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Go on.
L638919 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
L638918 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Tell me.
L638917 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
L638916 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes --
L638915 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
L638914 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
L638912 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
L638911 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where's your husband?
L638909 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Only this far.
L638908 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, don't go away!
L638906 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I had the dream. The dream came back again...
L638905 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why? What's happened?
L638904 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
L638863 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ All the time.
L638862 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Don't leave me... stay with me...
L638861 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
L638860 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm here, I've got you...
L638859 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
L638857 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
L638856 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
L638855 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No!
L638854 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ But I'm the woman in the mirror!
L638853 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
L638852 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No.
L638851 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
L638850 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
L638849 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What else?
L638848 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
L638847 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ There's a name on the gravestone.
L638846 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I know.
L638845 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How do you know?
L638844 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
L638843 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where?
L638842 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ A grave...
L638841 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What else?
L638840 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No... it's in shadow.
L638839 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Would you know the room?
L638838 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
L638837 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What do you remember?
L638836 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Vaguely...
L638835 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
L638832 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yesterday.
L638831 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
L638830 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
L638829 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
L638826 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ ...somewhere in the light.
L638825 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Home?
L638824 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Take me away from here?
L638823 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
L638822 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What?!
L638821 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, I can't tell you!
L638820 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What was it inside that told you to jump?
L638819 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No!
L638818 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why did you jump?
L638817 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
L638816 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
L638815 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, don't ask me!
L638814 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
L638813 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No!... No!
L638809 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where?
L638808 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Long ago...
L638807 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where were you born?
L638806 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ When?
L638805 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes...
L638804 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Have you been here before?
L638803 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ The tall trees...
L638802 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where?
L638801 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Here with you.
L638800 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where are you now?
L638798 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Madeleine!
L638797 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
L638796 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, thank you.
L638795 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Would you like a drink of water?
L638794 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No.
L638793 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No birds live here.
L638792 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ And no birds sing.
L638791 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Only silence. It's always like this.
L638790 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Do you hear anything?
L638787 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Knowing I have to die...
L638786 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why?
L638785 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I don't like them.
L638784 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
L638783 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
L638782 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What are you thinking?
L638780 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ The oldest living things?
L638779 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
L638778 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ How old?
L638777 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
L638776 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How can you be sure?
L638775 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
L638774 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Do you know where you're going?
L638771 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
L638770 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
L638769 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
L638768 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
L638767 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
L638766 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, I Just thought I'd wander.
L638765 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well... anywhere in particular?
L638764 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No.
L638763 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Shopping?
L638762 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I don't know.
L638760 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Good-bye.
L638759 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Good-bye.
L638758 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ We have.
L638757 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Meet again, sometime.
L638756 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ What?
L638755 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I hope we will, too.
L638754 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
L638753 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
L638752 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No! No, thank you!
L638751 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Would you like some coffee?
L638749 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I enjoyed talking to you.
L638748 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ -- talking to you...
L638747 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Not at all, I enjoyed --
L638746 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
L638745 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You've nothing to apologize for.
L638744 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
L638743 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
L638742 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I... suddenly felt such a fool.
L638741 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
L638740 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh! Yes. Hello.
L638726 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No... this is the first time for me, too.
L638725 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
L638724 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ ...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
L638723 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ What?
L638722 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
L638720 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No... it's wrong.
L638719 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Some people prefer it.
L638718 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ One shouldn't live alone.
L638717 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
L638716 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Wander about.
L638715 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
L638714 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
L638713 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
L638712 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
L638711 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
L638710 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ My name is John Ferguson.
L638709 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
L638708 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
L638707 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
L638706 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I... didn't know where you lived.
L638705 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
L638703 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Oh! Yes! Here!
L638702 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ When you...  There were pins in my hair...
L638701 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No.
L638700 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
L638699 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
L638698 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
L638696 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You like it, too.
L638695 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Wandering about.
L638694 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
L638693 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
L638692 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
L638691 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Please drink your coffee.
L638689 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
L638688 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh... wandering about.
L638687 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ This afternoon.
L638686 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ When?
L638685 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where had you been before?
L638684 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
L638683 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why?
L638682 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ ...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
L638681 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ At...
L638680 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where were you?
L638679 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
L638678 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Do you remember where you were?
L638677 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No...
L638676 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You don't remember.
L638668 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You...  ...fell into the Bay.
L638667 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Why am I here? What happened?
L638585 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ What car?
L638584 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Her car is gone.
L638582 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
L638581 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Would you please go and look?
L638580 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
L638579 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
L638578 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
L638577 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
L638576 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
L638575 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
L638574 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Does she sleep here? Ever?
L638573 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
L638572 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How long has she had the room?
L638571 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
L638570 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Carlotta Valdes?
L638569 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
L638568 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What is her name?
L638567 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
L638566 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Please answer my question.
L638565 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
L638564 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
L638563 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
L638562 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Oh, yes!
L638561 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes... you run this hotel.
L638560 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Is there something I can do for you?
L638894 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Oh?
L638893 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
L638892 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ No, not exactly. Want to see?
L638891 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What is it, a still life?
L638890 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
L638889 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
L638888 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
L638886 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Wandering.
L638885 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ What have you been doing?
L638884 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Naturally.
L638883 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
L638882 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What I've been doing?
L638881 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Oh... this and that.
L638880 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
L638879 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
L638878 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well, I detected an undercurrent.
L638877 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
L638876 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What was this desperate urge to see me?
L638875 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Oh?
L638874 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L638873 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Did you need it?
L638872 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Mm. Better.
L638871 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Oh?
L638870 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Around.
L638869 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Where?
L638868 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Just wander.
L638867 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
L638866 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
L638639 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Bye-bye!
L638638 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Midge!
L638636 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Mmm, yeah, I guess...
L638635 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
L638634 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Carlotta?
L638633 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Is she pretty?
L638632 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Think?  Well, what do you think?
L638631 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
L638630 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
L638629 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Out!
L638628 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
L638627 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Out. I've got things to do.
L638626 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Who's the guy, who's the wife?
L638625 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I've told you enough.
L638624 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ You haven't told me everything.
L638623 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Here you are.
L638621 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'll take you home.
L638620 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
L638619 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Nothing to tell.
L638618 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
L638617 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ For what?
L638616 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
L638610 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ And she died...
L638609 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ The poor thing....
L638600 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
L638599 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Pop Leibel? Sure.
L638598 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Do you know him well?
L638597 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
L638596 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
L638595 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
L638594 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Who?
L638593 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Pop Leibel.
L638592 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L638591 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
L638590 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
L638589 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
L638588 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
L638587 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
L638503 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
L638502 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Johnny!
L638501 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
L638500 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Easy, now.
L638498 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Okay.
L638497 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Step number two.
L638495 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
L638494 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
L638493 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
L638492 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ That!?!
L638491 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
L638490 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
L638489 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ How?
L638488 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I think I can lick it.
L638487 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
L638486 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ My... the acrophobia.
L638485 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ What.
L638484 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
L638483 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Sorry, old man. Work.
L638482 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
L638481 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
L638480 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Could be.
L638479 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ That's Skid Row... isn't it?
L638478 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
L638477 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
L638476 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
L638475 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Three whole weeks.
L638474 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
L638473 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
L638472 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Aren't you ever going to get married?
L638471 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Normal.
L638470 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well?
L638469 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ That's following a train of thought.
L638468 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How's your love life, Midge?
L638467 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What a pleasant hobby.
L638466 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
L638465 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Uh-huh!
L638464 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
L638463 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I've never run across one like that.
L638462 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
L638460 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Oh!
L638459 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ From that music.
L638458 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm having one now.
L638457 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
L638456 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
L638455 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
L638454 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
L638453 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Well?... what'll you do?
L638452 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Ah, Johnny-O...
L638451 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
L638450 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ It's where you belong.
L638449 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
L638448 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
L638447 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
L638446 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Johnny, the doctors explained --
L638445 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I know. Everybody tells me.
L638444 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ It wasn't your fault.
L638443 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
L638442 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Why?
L638441 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I had to quit, Midge.
L638440 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
L638439 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You sound so disapproving, Midge.
L638438 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
L638437 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L638436 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
L638435 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How do you know? Personal experience?
L638434 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ More than you think.
L638433 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
L638432 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
L638431 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ What's tomorrow?
L638430 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
L638429 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
L638428 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
L638427 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ I thought you said no more aches and pains?
L638426 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Ow!!
L638614 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
L638613 +++$+++ u8765 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ POP LEIBEL +++$+++ By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
L638612 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How?
L638611 +++$+++ u8765 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ POP LEIBEL +++$+++ She died.
L638607 +++$+++ u8765 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ POP LEIBEL +++$+++ By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child.
L638606 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ By whom?
L638605 +++$+++ u8765 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ POP LEIBEL +++$+++ It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
L638604 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
L638603 +++$+++ u8765 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ POP LEIBEL +++$+++ Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
L639153 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
L639152 +++$+++ u8766 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SALESWOMAN +++$+++ Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
L639151 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Can we have it by tonight?
L639150 +++$+++ u8766 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SALESWOMAN +++$+++ Well...
L639149 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How soon can it be altered?
L639148 +++$+++ u8766 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SALESWOMAN +++$+++ Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
L639145 +++$+++ u8766 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SALESWOMAN +++$+++ I thought so!
L639144 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes! That's it!
L639138 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
L639137 +++$+++ u8766 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SALESWOMAN +++$+++ She'll be out in a moment.
L639121 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted. 
L639120 +++$+++ u8766 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SALESWOMAN +++$+++ But you said grey, sir.
L639119 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
L640983 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
L640982 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Can't do what?
L640721 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
L640720 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
L640716 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
L640715 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ They'll get us on accesory to murder.
L640642 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't touch her. Call 911.
L640641 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Jesus.
L640632 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I need a drink.
L640631 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ She's fucking hot!
L640619 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Excellent.
L640618 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ The stripper's here.
L640938 +++$+++ u8780 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ SUIT +++$+++ Well that's what I said.
L640937 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I didn't hear you.
L640936 +++$+++ u8780 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ SUIT +++$+++ I said how's it going?
L640935 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What did you say?
L640934 +++$+++ u8780 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ SUIT +++$+++ What's that?
L640933 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What?
L640932 +++$+++ u8780 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ SUIT +++$+++ How ya doing?
L641029 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You go home!
L641028 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Go home!
L641027 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
L641026 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
L641019 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You fucking bastard!
L641018 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
L641007 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You're a loser.
L641006 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
L641004 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Eat my ass!
L641003 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ And you're a little fucking reject.
L641002 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ About anybody but yourself. You never have.
L640899 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
L640898 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
L640828 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What are you fucking talking about?
L640827 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
L640826 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ The hell I don't.
L640825 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ The hell you do.
L640824 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I have plenty of friends.
L640823 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
L640822 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't point at me.
L640821 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You're not a team player.
L640820 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What did you say?
L640819 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You're pathetic.
L640818 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ This is pathetic.
L640789 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It's sacrilegious.
L640788 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Why?
L640684 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Why?!
L640683 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ I don't know why the floor was wet!
L640682 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Why was the floor wet?
L640681 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ The floor was wet. She slipped!
L640654 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Playing?
L640653 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
L640644 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ She's dead.
L640643 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
L640559 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Franco mother-fucking Harris!
L640558 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
L640517 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I don't have to...
L640516 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Name one.
L640515 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Multiple reasons.
L640514 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Oh, and why am I an asshole?
L640513 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You're an asshole.
L640512 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You're an asshole Adam.
L640504 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
L640503 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
L640502 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
L640501 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
L640452 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Sorry Fish.
L640451 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You're interrupting a personal conversation.
L640450 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
L640449 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ First of all...
L640448 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
L641034 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
L641033 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
L641017 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I got children. I've got a life.
L641016 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ They won't figure it out.
L641015 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
L641014 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ It has worked.
L641013 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
L641012 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Adam! Calm down.
L641011 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
L641001 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I don't give a damn.
L641000 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
L640988 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Nobody's smoking anybody out.
L640987 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ They're on me. They're smoking me out!
L640986 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Who? What are you talking about?
L640985 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ At the seven-eleven.
L640984 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What?
L640981 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I can't do this.
L640980 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What is your problem?
L640912 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Any time fat boy!
L640911 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Fuck you Boyd!
L640910 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Watch the tone fella.
L640909 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't talk to me about character.
L640908 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
L640907 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
L640906 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
L640905 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You got us into this mess.
L640904 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What does that mean?
L640903 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
L640807 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
L640806 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
L640805 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
L640802 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Alright. Let's do it.
L640801 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I am not flexible on this.
L640800 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ We have to get going.
L640797 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
L640796 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
L640795 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That is absolutely not true.
L640794 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
L640793 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
L640792 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ So that's what we're doing.
L640791 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
L640790 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ How do you figure?
L640787 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
L640786 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ We've already done this.
L640785 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We can't do this.
L640784 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What?
L640783 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Wait. Wait a minute.
L640782 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm not wrecking the transmission!
L640781 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Sun rises at 5:52.
L640738 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
L640737 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Have you ever done this before?
L640736 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
L640735 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What about the blood?
L640734 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
L640733 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
L640732 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
L640719 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
L640718 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ So I didn't fucking do it!
L640717 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Her fucking head was caved in.
L640712 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
L640711 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
L640708 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
L640707 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
L640706 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ We can do this. We can get her out of here.
L640705 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
L640702 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Sure, why not.
L640701 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Bury her out in the desert.
L640698 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
L640697 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm calling the police.
L640696 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Just giving the facts.
L640695 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Just stop.
L640694 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ There's more.
L640693 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Stop it!
L640689 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
L640688 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
L640687 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
L640686 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
L640685 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
L640680 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
L640679 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Are you sure this was an accident?
L640676 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
L640675 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
L640674 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
L640665 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Why?
L640664 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We have to call the ambulance.
L640663 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Why?  Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
L640662 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Calling the ambulance.
L640661 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
L640660 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm calling the ambulance.
L640659 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What do you think you are doing?
L640658 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L640657 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What are you doing?
L640656 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What?
L640655 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Wait!
L640648 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You don't know what you're doing.
L640647 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ She's got no fucking pulse.
L640551 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
L640550 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ More.
L640545 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
L640544 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
L640543 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
L640524 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You want to hear me out?
L640523 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't even start.
L640520 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm not getting a ticket.
L640519 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
L640959 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
L640958 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ There is no candy!
L640957 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Where's the candy?
L640944 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
L640943 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Later.
L640942 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ They're screaming for Starbursts.
L640941 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What?
L640940 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
L640930 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ They're singing.
L640929 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ They're driving me nuts!
L640928 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Don't snap at them!
L640965 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Where's the bathroom?
L640964 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I got you.
L640963 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
L640962 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
L640961 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Have you thought about what I said?
L640852 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
L640851 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I don't think so.
L640850 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
L640849 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What.
L640848 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I want you to hear me out.
L640799 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It has to be done.
L640798 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No way.
L640652 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What happened? Oh my God...
L640651 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
L640617 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
L640616 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I know...
L640615 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ If anything ever happens to me...
L640614 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I know and I'm honored...
L640613 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
L640609 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't eyeball your kids.
L640608 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I won't do it.
L640607 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't ever stare him down.
L640606 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
L640592 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
L640591 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No. I think it's fucked.
L640590 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Are you solid with that?
L640589 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
L640588 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
L640555 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
L640554 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Real times.
L640542 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No...we want padded chairs...okay?
L640541 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That's one idea.
L640454 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I know you'll be.  Three hours.
L640453 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ We'll be ready Adam.
L641236 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
L641235 +++$+++ u8769 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BARRY MORRIS +++$+++ So. When is the wedding.
L641228 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ So where's that leave us?
L641227 +++$+++ u8769 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BARRY MORRIS +++$+++ And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
L641226 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Well, oh...
L641225 +++$+++ u8769 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BARRY MORRIS +++$+++ Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
L641221 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ What does that mean?
L641220 +++$+++ u8769 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BARRY MORRIS +++$+++ Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
L641219 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Money?
L641214 +++$+++ u8769 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BARRY MORRIS +++$+++ There's more.
L641213 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ My god.
L641136 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Lois please.
L641135 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
L641134 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
L641130 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
L641129 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
L641128 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
L641124 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
L641123 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Nothing happened in Vegas.
L641122 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
L641121 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
L641120 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Don't sweet lip me.
L641119 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L640766 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
L640765 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's in there!
L640763 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Great. Fine. Perfect.
L640762 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Is everything okay?
L640761 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Sweet deal.
L640760 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That's right.
L640759 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ She's still working?
L640758 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
L640757 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
L640756 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That's right.
L640755 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Doing the bachelor party thing?
L640754 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Yup.
L640751 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ The groom?
L640750 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Who?
L640749 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ So who's the lucky guy?
L640748 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Okay. Hi.
L640746 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
L640745 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Where is she?
L640744 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's not here.
L640743 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ I'm with Tina. Is she there?
L640742 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What?
L640741 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
L640740 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What is it?
L641204 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
L641203 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ He's too drunk.
L641114 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Give me two more.
L641113 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ He just had two.
L641097 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What is her disposition?
L641096 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ What's goosed?
L641080 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I'm not talking to you?
L641079 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ What's your fucking point?
L640857 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
L640856 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
L640804 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Here's his head.
L640803 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I got her arm.
L640704 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
L640703 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ He's right.
L640650 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Left side.
L640649 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Where do you look? What side of the neck?
L640561 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
L640560 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
L640557 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Not tonight.
L640556 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ But not tonight.
L640547 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
L640546 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ I don't think so Boyd.
L640538 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
L640537 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Your investment ideas never work out.
L640528 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Fish?
L640527 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ No I don't.
L641286 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ You need help.
L641285 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
L641284 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Not a prayer.
L641283 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
L641282 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ You're sick.
L641281 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
L641278 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
L641277 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I'm serious.
L641276 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Whatever you say Kojak.
L641275 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Fine? Fine what?
L641274 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Okay fine.
L641273 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
L641272 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
L641271 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
L641270 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ My what?
L641269 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
L641268 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
L641197 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
L641196 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Isn't it a little late?
L641195 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That's right.
L641194 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Now?
L641193 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
L641192 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Hear what?
L641191 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
L641190 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Yeah.
L641189 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
L641188 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What does that mean?
L641187 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
L641153 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You got a nasty side to your thought process.
L641152 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I don't know...
L641151 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
L641150 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What does that mean?
L641149 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Take care of business.
L641148 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L641147 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Just do it.
L641146 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I don't think that's such a good idea.
L641145 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
L641117 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Suck my ass.
L641116 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
L641100 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
L641099 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
L641098 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Regarding what?
L641082 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
L641081 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What's your point?
L641078 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Exactly! Exactly my point.
L641077 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I just want to get married.
L641076 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What you just said. Say it again.
L641075 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What?
L641074 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Say it again.
L641073 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I don't know! I just want to get married.
L641072 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
L641071 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I said, what have we done?
L641070 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What is the question you asked me?
L641069 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What?
L641068 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What did you ask me?
L641067 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Boyd...What have we done?
L641066 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ He is not cracking up.
L641065 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ He's cracked up.
L641047 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
L641046 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Easy Boyd.
L640977 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ He's having a problem here.
L640976 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
L640975 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Shut up Boyd.
L640974 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
L640972 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
L640971 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
L640968 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ You always were a jealous man.
L640967 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
L640861 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
L640860 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
L640830 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
L640829 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
L640814 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Go ahead.
L640813 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I'm talking about prayer.
L640812 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What kind of words?
L640811 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I think we should say some words over the grave.
L640810 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
L640774 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
L640773 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I'm calling the police.
L640772 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
L640730 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Good God...Good God...
L640729 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Nobody knows she's here.
L640714 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
L640713 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Oh God. This is insane.
L640710 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Nobody knows.
L640709 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
L640692 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
L640691 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
L640671 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Shut up.
L640670 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Call 911.
L640669 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Shut up.
L640668 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ She's dead. Call somebody!
L640667 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ No.
L640666 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Oh, Jesus...call the police.
L640624 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I can't.
L640623 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
L640534 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
L640533 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ We need padded chairs.
L640532 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
L640531 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
L640530 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
L640529 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
L640522 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Who's up for making some real money?
L640521 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
L640511 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Well, I didn't mean it.
L640510 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ You said that Boyd.
L641202 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ I love you.
L641201 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
L641200 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ How about my Fatburger?
L641199 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
L641112 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Give me the Valium.
L641111 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Goosed!
L641110 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Stop.
L641109 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Goosed!
L641108 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Stop it!
L641102 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
L641101 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ We're goosed! Goosed by God!
L641095 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ We're not goosed.
L641094 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ We're goosed.
L641055 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
L641054 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Easy Micheal.
L641053 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
L641052 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
L641051 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Ball park sausages.
L641050 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
L641025 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You will not screw this up.
L641024 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ This is going to stop right now. Right now!
L640902 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
L640901 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You said nobody would miss her.
L640900 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
L640777 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
L640776 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Not really, no.
L640775 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
L640612 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
L640611 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ They need leadership.
L640610 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
L640605 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
L640604 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ What?
L640603 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Take Mexico.
L640602 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ What? What's your point?
L640601 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ There's my point exactly.
L640600 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
L640599 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
L640598 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ What's your point?
L640597 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
L640596 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
L640595 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Then what do they have?
L640594 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Israel doesn't have a King.
L640593 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
L640587 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ New king.
L640586 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ And what happens when you can't?
L640585 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
L640584 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You have a King fantasy.
L640583 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Not true.
L640582 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ True.
L640581 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ False.
L640580 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You hate women.
L640579 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I don't hate women.
L640540 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Oh really? Starbucks?
L640539 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Your ideas never work out.
L640526 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Moore?
L640525 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Nope.
L640509 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I never heard that.
L640508 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
L640507 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The hell I did!
L640506 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ The hell you didn't!
L640505 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The hell I did!
L640500 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ It's my fucking opinion.
L640499 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You're a fucking moron.
L641296 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I do.
L641295 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
L641293 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ The rings?
L641292 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What?
L641291 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ May we have the rings please?
L640876 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
L640875 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Are we supposed to?
L640874 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
L640873 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
L641324 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
L641323 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ But...
L641322 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You put him down or don't bother coming back.
L641321 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No...
L641320 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
L641319 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What?
L641318 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
L641317 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
L641313 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Move the bodies?
L641312 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Move the bodies.
L641311 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ So what do we do?
L641310 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ The only proof is those bodies.
L641309 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
L641308 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Like how?
L641307 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
L641306 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ What does that mean?
L641305 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ He kept saying he was protected.
L641280 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What money?
L641279 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
L641265 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
L641264 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ But...
L641263 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
L641262 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ But...
L641261 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
L641260 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
L641259 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
L641258 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
L641257 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
L641256 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ It's too late.
L641255 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Call the police.
L641254 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Micheal, by accident.
L641253 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You killed a prostitute.
L641252 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No Micheal did. It was an accident.
L641251 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You fucked a prostitute?
L641250 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ The prostitute.
L641249 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Who's dead?
L641248 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
L641247 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L641246 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
L641245 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ What kind of stupid question is that?
L641244 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Do you love me?
L641243 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ What?
L641242 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Do you love me?
L641241 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Don't even.
L641240 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
L641239 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
L641238 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No it's not okay. It's not.
L641237 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
L641224 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Yes.
L641223 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ No.
L641222 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
L641163 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Okay. Okay.
L641162 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Yeah. You.
L641161 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
L641160 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
L641159 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
L641158 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I won't even discuss it.
L641157 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I know.
L641156 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ We're not canceling.
L641155 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
L641089 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
L641088 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Can we just talk this out?
L641087 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ No way.
L641086 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
L641085 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!

There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never. #Disgust, Disappointment
