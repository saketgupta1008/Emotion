L30123 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention. #NONE

L30817 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that? #Disgust,Fear

L30814 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece. #Joy,Surprise
L30813 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics. #Disgust,Anticipation
L30812 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here. #Surprise
L30809 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy. #Anger,Trust

L30767 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him. #NONE

L30284 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect. #Joy,Anger
L30281 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer? #Joy
L30280 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less. #Fear,Anticipation

L30275 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate. #NONE

Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no? #NONE

L30379 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What is this, Herr Chamberlain? #Anger
L30826 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty. #Sadness
L30825 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends? #NONE
L30824 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes? #Trust
L30823 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous? #Trust

L30184 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ I don't think it was really decided, Director. #Fear,Anger
L31341 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute. #Anger,Fear
L31340 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Oh my son, my poor son! #Sadness,Joy
L31339 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God! #Joy,Fear
L31338 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it? #Sadness,Anticipation

L31336 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ But not his body. #Sadness,Joy
L31335 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ I poisoned his life. #Fear,Sadness

L31076 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands. #Fear,Anger
L31075 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Yes. #Anticipation,Trust
L31074 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you? #Surprise,Fear
L31073 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ What? #Sadness,Surprise
L30474 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture. #Sadness

L30470 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him! #NONE
L30469 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know. #NONE
L30468 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ No? Was Mozart a good man? #NONE
L30467 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ You cannot say that! #Disgust,Surprise
L30466 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God. #Trust,Anger
L30342 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray! #Fear,Surprise
L30341 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Did you try? #Fear,Joy
L30340 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them. #NONE
L30029 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered. #NONE

L30798 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor. #Disgust,Sadness

It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...

The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.

L638541 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all. #Disgust,Anger

L638537 +++$+++ u8759 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ ELSTER +++$+++ I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why... #Anger,Sadness

There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never. #Disgust, Disappointment
